Recently, the frequent strikes by health workers have brought to light the fact that as a country we have an inefficient system that has gone unchecked for such a long time. It also highlights that the country’s priorities are not aligned with the global development agenda where improving health is one of the key pillars. In this paper, I elaborately paint a picture of the country’s healthcare system with special focus on the increasing frequency of health worker strikes. The country’s political climate in the recent past has been tense and implementing processes geared towards change is taking longer than expected. Considering this, I highlight the problems that the country is facing focusing on the collective bargaining agreement that has long been ignored and delve deeper into how this fits into the global picture. While doing so, I discuss in detail the shortcomings of the system, the reasons for these shortcomings and what has been done so far to address the existing problems. In addition to this, the paper gives policy recommendations drawn from systems around the world. Some of the cited recommendations have been implemented in other developing countries and have proven effective.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1524k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Experience of Asian crisis shaped the regional cooperation to build structure for long term capital markets, which led to strong tailwinds of policy structures through ASEAN Plus Three (APT) to promote bond financing. In this regard, this study uses Autoregression model, first difference of panel regression and granger causality to i) determine the direction of causality between bond market development and economic growth ii) analyze the effect of bond market development on economic growth for ten East Asian economies for the period of 2004-2016. Two categories of bond market size are used to determine bond market development, namely local currency bond market and foreign currency bond market to explore the bond market development. The result shows that while bond market has positive and significant effect on economic growth in the regional economies, it was also discovered that the causality flows from economic growth to bond market development. It is recommended that with continued development of capital markets, economic growth could continue in same path while at the same time, economic growth policies should bring greater emphasis to capital market deepening for strengthening symbiotic relationship between bond markets and growth of the region.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (859k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Bangladesh has cost advantage over its major global competitors like China, India, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia for producing various garment products. Therefore, building sustainable business relations between small and medium clothing brands in this region with Bangladeshi garments manufacturers would be a decisive business plan for a new entrepreneur. Bangladesh is a popular destination for major global retailers for apparels like H&M, Walmart, C&A, GAP, and JCPenney. However, the Bangladeshi readymade garments market is yet to be explored by the emerging clothing brands in the Central and Eastern European region. Therefore, the business idea here is to initiate a 3rd-party agency to help bridging Central and Eastern European clothing brands with the Bangladeshi manufacturers. The business here will be 100 percent equity-based initiative and require a total of 430,000 euro as the initial investment. According to the business plan, 60 percent of the equity will be possessed by external investors, the rest 40 percent will be under the founders of that agency. This business plan finds that with an initial investment of 430,000 Euro, after five consecutive years of operations, the business would receive a total revenue of 1,105,272 Euro. The expected internal rate of return (IRR) here is 30 percent to 35 percent. This report mainly focuses on introducing eco-friendly and workers friendly low-cost Bangladeshi garments’ manufacturers to relevant enterprises especially in Hungary, Denmark, Poland, and Germany. In addition to cost advantage, Bangladeshi garments have gained fame globally for its quality too. In fact, Bangladesh houses the highest 67 green garments factory in the world. According to recent reports, 300 more green garments’ factories are in the process to start their operations in the coming years. Therefore, outsourcing garments’ products from Bangladesh would open new window of opportunities for both entrepreneurs and consumers in the Central European region.', 'Note': 'Degree: MSc', 'File Type': 'PDF file (238k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Yet, the ripple of the Great Recession was felt at different ends of the global economy due to financial interconnectedness. Faced with this reality, emerging market economies need to find a balance in the trade-off between financial openness and capital control. This thesis explores the effect of capital controls on output volatility in ten emerging and frontier Asian economies. The thesis uses panel data for the year 1995 to 2015 from IMF and the World Bank for Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong. The capital control indexes developed by Schindler (2009) from IMFâ€™s AREAER Reports are used to gauge the level of capital restrictions in the economies. Using a fixed effects method with fourth-order autocorrelation, the study finds that average capital controls have a significant negative effect on output volatility. This also holds for controls on capital outflows. However, there is no evidence in support of using controls based on the type of asset. Additionally, good institutions support the effectiveness of capital controls in curbing output volatility. The study concludes that the emerging Asian economies maintaining some level of average capital controls have experienced less output volatility. However, the cost of this policy risks stunting the growth of the domestic financial markets. The policy implications the analysis is discussed further.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1776k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

With implementing a field experiment in a secondary school programme of a Hungarian extracurricular institution, I investigate whether students are more likely visiting events if personalised mails are received.I find that in the first round of the experiment, the participation rate is 9 percentage points higher among those who received an invitation letter with their name on the headings. I also examine an alternative mailing technique, in which the results are not different significantly from the standard personalised letters or the control group either. Due to the randomised controlled trial methodology, the internal validity of my research is quite high.

Nevertheless, while the empirical literature on how fiscal rules can help countries achieve better fiscal outcomes has grown in the period, it remains an open question if the market actually does take in consideration the existence and stringency of fiscal rules when defining the risk premium of emerging economies. In this study, we argue that, due to the nature of fiscal rules, they are not an indicator internalized by investors when assessing a countryâ€™s default risk. Counting with a unique index to measure Fiscal Rules Strength across 14 emerging economies, we investigate what part does the strength of fiscal rules play in defining sovereign bond spreads. Using panel data from 1998 to 2014, we were able to confirm that strengthening fiscal rules has no direct effect on spreads. However, we also uncovered that stronger fiscal rules make a small difference when a country faces changes in other fundamentals. First, they can have a dampening effect on how much spreads increase in times of deteriorating debt. Second, they can increment the negative effect that accumulating Reserves has on spreads. Both effects are small, but statistically significant.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1774k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

After gaining independence South Sudan economy has been faced with a number of challenges as the government tries to implement its development objectives. On 11 November 2013, the Central Bank of South Sudan made changes to its official exchange rate which was initially pegged to United States dollar by devaluing its currency by 42% and further by 84% in 2015. This act resulted into general increase in the prices of goods and services since the country is import dependent to a large extent. This research paper will try to understand whether the currency devaluation could be a lead cause towards the increased inflation and even hyperinflation in the country. Secondly, the research will also try to investigate the extent to which Central Bank is independent and how the lack of independence helped the emergence of hyperinflation in South Sudan. The research will also try to analyze the inflationary historical aspects of the East African region based on the precolonial and postcolonial times so as to examine other factors that might have caused inflation in the region while addressing the economic growth challenges. The research will also take into consideration a theoretical overview of Sudan and South Sudan economy before and after independence since these two countries were once one.

The results are in line with the theory of decreased slope of the Philips curve (Blanchard, 2014): the output responds more, the inflation responds less to a monetary tightening. If interest rate policy aims to decrease inflation, there is bigger “growth” price to pay than before the crisis.

I analyze the gender differences in risk-taking and domain choice of entrepreneurs through examining more than 15 thousand product development projects initiated on the largest reward-based crowdfunding website, Kickstarter. I find no gender difference in risk-taking and success in terms of setting and reaching the desired target amount, but I find that men collect/receive more premium over their goal. Using topic modelling on the textual descriptions of the campaigns, I show that women and men engage in different fields, and women tend to choose less lucrative domains. Domain choice explains a substantial part of the gender gap in premium on Kickstarter. Based on these findings, as a first step towards narrowing the gender gap in access to capital, traditional sources of financing should adapt more transparent and equitable policies as seen on crowdfunding platforms. However, for long term change, regulators need to take into account deeper underlying social structures that affect men and women's domain choices and that cannot be addressed solely by changing entrepreneurship policies."", 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1031k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I find that precipitation’s effect on volunteer activity is heterogenous across the United States, since it mostly affects compliers at those states which are classified with snow climates. Because of the huge regional wage differences in these states, I show that the use of nominal wages as a dependent variable violates the independence assumption of the LATE estimation and downward biases the estimation results, while the use of living-cost-adjusted wages can eliminate this bias.

With some countries still planning to join the Union and others already leaving (the United Kingdom), good quality empirical research is key to an informed political debate. Such analysis is, however, scarce (particularly for Central and Eastern European countries), mainly due to the challenges that traditional statistical methods face in providing reliable causal estimates for these questions, especially in absence of good counterfactuals. Synthetic Control Method used in this thesis attempts to overcome the issue by constructing synthetic counterfactuals for Central and Eastern European countries from the most similar economies outside of the Union. This, in turn, allows for more reliable causal estimates of the benefits of the latter. According to the results of the analysis, the Baltic States might have benefited the most from EU membership, both before and after the financial crisis. Czech Republic followed a similar path but with somewhat lower overall positive impacts, as the income convergence theory would predict. Poland also experienced some benefits but only during and after the financial crisis (mainly by avoiding it).

Using 1998, 2005, 2011 wage data from the National Employment Office, the regression-compatible decompositions at the mean show that the total wage gap in my sample increases over time, while the explained gap is negative in all the years, particularly due to firm characteristics, occupation and residence indicators. Along the distribution, the gender wage gap is upward sloping, indicating the glass ceiling effect for women. Before the recession, the total explained gap is positive starting from 95-99 quantile, while after the recession the total explained gap is negative at all the quantiles, especially due to education reversal. Thus, although before the recession women were less qualified for high paying jobs, in 2011 the women should earn higher wages at any quantile of the wage distribution in the absence of unexplained gap. To address the robustness of my findings I use the matching approach proposed by Ã‘opo (2008), which addresses the issue of differences in the supports of the distributions of characteristics.

The research analyzes the role of the quality of institutions in reducing natural resource curse, the appropriate policies used to reduce natural resource curse, and the ways of good institutions in fostering economic growth and development. The natural resource curse states that bad institutions fail to foster economic growth and development. In this thesis, Botswana represents an African country with good institutions in the management of natural resource for state building, hence a blessing. Meanwhile, South Sudan represents an African country with weak institutions in natural resource management, hence a curse. In South Sudan, this has led to the collapse of the economy coupled with the existing conflicts in the country, forcing more than 2 million people to exile in the neighboring country. The main aim of this thesis is to find out whether institutions quality can reduce natural resource curse. The findings show that, South Sudan has weak institutions which explain the natural resource curse. It's important for the government of South Sudan to invest in human and physical to achieved economic growth and development. This investment in turn contribute good institutions. Additionally, there is need to diversify the economy, set and implement fiscal regimes, and sovereign wealth fund.

The latter, number (iv), is the main contribution of my thesis, as this has not been addressed by previous studies. The first strategy uses only half of the sample to identify the effects of both treatments on both pair members, in certain complier subpopulations, under the usual instrumental variables assumptions. The second strategy, the main theoretical result, uses the whole sample to identify the same treatment effects, but this comes at the cost of additional strict symmetry assumptions on the members' participation willingness. To explore the impact of the violation of symmetry on consistency, some Monte Carlo results are presented.  The use of the design is illustrated, in theory, on a sample of married couples where one member suffers from depression.

With rising importance of tight oil comes need for an assessment of the relationship between shale industry and global crude prices. Thus, this paper’s aim was to evaluate the relationship between changes in oil prices, rigs counts and tight oil production in the U.S. in 2005-2018 while controlling for economic and financial variables. The VARX model was used to assess the relationship. The model was constructed based on Khalifa et al. (2017) with some adjustments. The results suggest that rig counts and tight oil output are responsive to the oil price shock. Though, the initial response is negative, the rig counts displayed statistically significant positive response with 2-month lag. This outcome is consistent with the literature and economic theory. Other key finding was that unlike common market believe the changes in rig counts and tight oil production do not have a direct and positive relationship. This outcome further strengthens the call to look beyond the rig counts when assessing the shale industry’s ‘health’. The changes in rig counts and oil output have only a minor impact on oil prices. But still the trend is negative, which is consistent with recent oil market developments.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1595k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

After a significant improvement in the government’s fiscal balances following the Great Recession, the fiscal position started to deteriorate again, even as the economic output is above its potential level, and major social programs of the federal government are running towards insolvency. Interest rates have also started to rise increasing financing cost of government debt in the future. The goal of this paper to analyze how different fiscal policy decisions and interest rate trajectories effect public debt outcomes in the time period of the next 14 years. We also explore how a possible recession would impact the debt level. For these calculations we use a model which decomposes changes in the public debt to GDP ratio into four factors: real GDP growth, inflation, nominal interest rate, primary balance, and captures their interactions. In our analysis we confirm the findings of the Congressional Budget Office that US federal government debt is on an unsustainable path. We also concluded that contrary to our expectations changes in the average real short-term equilibrium interest rate in the time horizon of our analysis has no major impact on government debt. Furthermore, we find that a recession can lead to a larger public debt overhang for a longer period despite the government best efforts to reduce it. In our key fiscal policy recommendation suggest the federal government to start a fiscal consolidation program as soon as possible, reversing the effect of previous pro-cyclical measures to gain fiscal space preparing for a possible economic downturn.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1852k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Using these centile groupings I first analyze the female shares and actual annual earnings in each part of the distribution. Then, I build counterfactuals that control for the differences in gender shares in each of the four centile groupings, resulting in a simulated wage distribution that assumes the same share of women that the actual share of men is in each of the centile groupings. Then I use the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to learn how much part of the gender wage gap the centile groupings account for. Doing this, I find that the counterfactual earnings ratio -- unlike in other developed countries -- gives less favorable results for women in Hungary. Furthermore, it turns out that using the widest possible model, the inequality in Hungary is higher than the difference in earnings, thus having the centile groupings to explain more of the gap than the gap itself.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (597k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The number of general education lessons – such as mathematics, literature and natural sciences –taught per week were severely cut as part of these reforms in vocational secondary education schools, and it is expected that pupils will see a deterioration in their above-named skills.

Results show that numeracy and literacy skills do matter in all 3 of the aspects.

When all voters are rational, the interest group truthfully reveals an interval in which the true optimal policy lies if its bias is not too large. When a sufficiently large fraction of the electorate is credulous the interest group's campaign overstates its policy bias and can always ensure that its own optimal policy is implemented.

One if these areas – and one of the main culprits behind green-house gasses – is the energy sector, which still mainly relies on conventional energy sources. However, with the recent technological developments, renewable energy sources are becoming more and more competitive, which means that more and more countries include renewable energy support in their policy mix. Solar photovoltaics is one of these energy sources, that had been responsible for a very significant part of the recent growth in renewable energy share. Solar PV is often supported by policy mechanism, feed-in tariff being one of the most often employed one. But lately more countries have decided to significantly decrease feed-in tariffs for solar PV – such as Germany – or completely dismantle the system – such as the United Kingdom. In this paper I will investigate the effects of feed-in tariff contribution changes in order to see whether these policy changes are taking countries on the right path, towards a renewable-rich future. I will discuss relevant policies world-wide and in Germany, and analyse time-series data from Germany in order to reach my conclusion, which is that while decreasing feed-in tariff do affect solar PV adoption, the slowdown could be necessary to avoid any long-lasting damage to consumers or utilities.

This was both before and after the accession to the European Union and the European Research Area (ERA) in 2004. To understand how international knowledge flows impact the previously more secluded regions of Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, social network and econometric analyses are carried out based on the 2015 OECD REGPAT database. In the OLS and propensity score weighted difference-in-differences model radicalness is used as a quality measure. Radicalness measures how many different IPC technology classes the cited patents belong to. The findings show that regions of the EU8 have a 18.3 percentage point higher radicalness on average after treatment than the control group of Romania and Bulgaria. While joining the EU has a statistically significant positive effect on radicalness it cannot be regarded as international knowledge transfer, as is shown through the E-I index. Instead, the more inward-looking regions are, the better they are at patenting. International inventors are marginal in the collaboration network and thus are unable to create knowledge spillovers to other inventors they do not directly interact with. The seclusion of foreigners in the CEE region is supported by comparing the centralities of CEE and international inventors. These findings reveal that the benefits of the European Union lead inventors to better patenting and highlight the shortcomings of the ERA. In order to have successful knowledge flows it is not sufficient to only encourage the quantity of international collaborations. Foreign inventors also need to be embedded in the patenting network, so the innovation that is brought about by them can further spill over in the region and have a long-term effect.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1377k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The system went through a transition process which resulted in the emergence of market elements in the 1990s and early 2000s. However, as Kornai (2015) described Hungary’s transition in general, a dramatic U-turn came about afterwards. The thesis reveals this U-turn in relation to the governance and financing of the healthcare system showing how centralization has become significant in recent years. Both theoretical (e.g. soft budget constraint) and practical (e.g. bed occupancy rate, share of private expenditures) elements are examined. Soft budget constraint’s presence is supported by the reaccumulating hospital sector debt and the political importance of it following a similar cyclical path. This is shown with text analysis using minutes of the Parliament, a so-far unexplored method in this area. Besides, results of data envelopment analysis demonstrate that the rise of this debt is not associated with any improvement in the technical efficiency of hospitals. Further analyses present the recentralizing tendency of the current decade with the decreasing role of voluntary payments and increasing significance of central budget contributions in the Hungarian healthcare system. Policy recommendations include the restoration of local governments’ ownership of hospitals, making hospital managers responsible for the cost-effectiveness of their institutions and the reduction of hospital beds.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1530k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The results indicated that an increase in a state’s implementation score triggered an increase in their manufacturing sector’s GDP. The composite nature of the score limited this study from identifying precisely which reforms affected manufacturing. In the attempt to overcome this limitation, the study explored the reforms attributed to the extraordinary increase of India’s place in the World Bank EODB index in the same 2015-2017 time period as way of discerning specific reforms that conceivably affected the manufacturing sector.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1640k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

An increase in political representation and participation of women strengthens the democratic system of a country and contributes to gender equality. In this paper I will focus on studying the relationship between increased female political representation in Pakistan on the level of their economic empowerment. I took the proportion of women in National Assembly as the indicator for female representation and the female labor force participation as the indicator for the economic empowerment of women in the country. Since there are a number of factors such as gender role attitudes, level of female education, rate of urbanization, and cultural, societal and religious norms, that impact both, female representation and their labor force participation, there is a chance of endogeneity in the model. To solve the problem of endogeneity, Iâ€™ve used gender quotas as an instrumental variable to represent the proportion of women in the parliament and have used the Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) method to conduct the empirical analysis. Results show that increasing the proportion of women in the National Assembly has a significantly positive impact on the female labor force participation in Pakistan.

Improving women’s health is a key objective for almost all the developing countries.

Recently, there has been an improvement in reducing the maternal and infant mortality rate in Bangladesh. However, the country is still struggling with the rate of health risks faced by adolescent mothers. Socioeconomic indicators such as educational status, knowledge about healthy food and health services are impacting the health risks of adolescent mothers. In my thesis, I seek to examine that how educational status itself as a social indicator has an impact on the health of the mothers. The estimation of the relation between educational status and mother’s health was taken using two different estimation models: Probit Analysis and OLS Regression. I found a significant relationship between safe child birth and the educational background of the participant and her husband. Increase in educational level has a positive impact in increasing the rate of safe child birth. I found no correlation between a vast number of factors related to maternal health and education. Based on these findings, as an important step to improve maternal health, ensuring the overall educational status of the nation is the most feasible measure for the government.

The essence of EMS business model is to specialize in pooling resources of in-house manufacturing, raw materials (RMs) procurement, and finished goods (FGs) logistics delivery with maximized economies of scale, flexibility, and service quality as well as minimum operating costs. Based on the characteristics of product line, we can split to High Mix Low Volume (HMLV) and High Volume Low Mix (HVLM). Mix generally stands for the complexity or difficulty of different product sets, and Volume refers the number of unit built. Typically, lower tier EMS provides HMLV and higher Tier provides HVLM. How an EMS responds to sudden spike in customer demands with quick and efficient actions decides its success level. Cloud Network Technology Kft, known as Foxconn Hungary, has been offering the buy-and-sell Contract Manufacturing (CMs) services via build-to-order (BTO) model, for Huawei Technologies (Huawei) Telecom & Communication Division, who owns R&D, materials planning, and supply chain management (SCM). A comprehensive operational management in efficiency has been the focal concept when Foxconn began the business partnership with Huawei since 2009. The whole order fulfillment is basically composed of sales demand management, RM planning, in-house production and test, packing, FG logistics, warehousing and custom services. To effectively ensure we are on the right pace, Foxconn Hungary has been defining, verifying, implementing, and monitoring KPIs time by time. However, the rapidly growing customized demands have brought the impacts led by unpredictable and unbalanced sales demands as well as the increasing customer requests (CSRs). In response to the HMLV market characteristics in Europe, the development of manpower skills, systematic processes, and the conceptually smart systems enable the rapid order fulfillments cycles and balance demand and supply. In addition to the traditional advantages on lean management, Foxconn has also been reinforcing its service values and strengthening the competitive strengths by adopting or developing various IT systems and platforms. With the various efforts of digital transformations, Foxconn streamlines the process as its well-known intellectual properties, and this framework, has essentially been playing a critical role in standardizing the electronic manufacturing services for OEMs in a service-oriented manner. The streamlined systems sometimes act as the role of a double-edged blade, bringing more resistance to mutual operations and requiring more efforts for workflow improvements; for example, those high-tech-savvy companies who own their own systems and flows as Apple or Huawei. Providing BTO model and serving HMVL customized orders in Europe, Foxconn has been experiencing the difficulties of capacity management in a balance way. It depends highly on the order configurations, allocation, CSRs of Huawei orders. Unlike the build-to-forecast (BTF) model, the biggest problem with the BTO model is how to ensure that the capacity is matched to the order quantity with the frequent fluctuation. Huawei Europe Supply Center (ESC) collects sales orders from the sales representativesâ€™ offices spread in EMEA regions, and sends out to EMS for value-add services by request date. Telecom products do not have as significant seasonal factor or wave as consuming electronic products do, and is suitable for the BTF model. Nevertheless, a large number of telecom service providers and countries in Europe make it hard to predict. When different needs arise, the number of product portfolios will be growing considerably. Additionally, the easy-to-see and unchanging sales strategy, which the sales representatives always offer price-cutting competition by the deadline of financial reports, has made more EMEA telecom service providers be aware and bought wireless base station products (WL) as well as servers at a comparatively lower price at the end of the month and the end of the quarter. The phenomenon has prevented that Foxconn Hungary effectively leverage the capacity and resource to every month on an average basis through the well-built integrated Foxconn systems with ease. Instead, the business characteristics become the main mutual pain points. In terms of Huawei business, the capacity management and output management are largely limited by the orders Foxconn Hungary receives from time to time. The benefits of continual digitalized operations and improvements have been promoting to tackle the problem. However, in reality, there are more than 20 IT systems operating in this business partnership, starting from Huawei purchase orders (POs) generation to FGs shipments. The two-sided systems communicate with many manual interfaces on a daily basis, and the information sharing and transmission also have gap in time as expected. To achieve more reliable forecasting, customer demands coordination, materials preparation, production and shipment real-time priority management, equipment and tooling maintenance, warehouse management, layout design, and property and information security, the automated IT systems communications, big data analytics, information transfer under security management for decision-making is an imperative lifeline for EMS survival from the Red Sea Competition. We attain to introduce an ongoing-discussion intelligent system and working model in terms of optimizing supply & demand management in EMS, which enable the automatic order fulfillment activities to ease capacity planning issues and demand fluctuations in this project. After, we will evaluate the operating strategy with thorough analysis about investments and returns, and suggestions.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (406k)', 'Local note': 'Capstone project', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The results suggest that Gini index of education decreases dramatically from 0.506 for people born between 1940 and 1944 to 0.172 from people born between 1990 and 1994. Meanwhile, income inequality implies an alarming sign, increasing dramatically. By stratifying 31 Chinese provinces into three regions East, Central and West, I find education inequality is severe in central part of China due to limited educational resources, while income inequality is more obvious in the coastal and industrialized Eastern part of China because of occupational differentiations. Then, I construct a sample scalar measure of inequality of opportunity which captures between-group inequality where groups are defined entirely by some factors that beyond individual controls such as Hukou system of household registration, gender and family background.

The main findings show that CSOK amplifies the reactions of the housing market variables, thus the mortgage market becomes riskier, house prices fall deeper, borrowers decrease their housing stock and consumption, while a larger share of borrowers lose their houses because they default on their mortgages.

The project was based on a previous initiative, that had some lacklusters. After carefully understanding the previous project’s outcome, I tried to incorporate every usefull piece in the proof on concept I wanted to create, and offer a solution that is the closest for the previous client’s needs. After a consultation with an external expert, I ensured myself, that there is no estabilished methodology for demand prediction upon doing estimation through instable peers. Therefore, I decided that the proof of concept project will have the following goals: I. helps in careful feature selection regarding target allocation based on the original form of the data, without assigning proportional scores, or relative intuitive wieghts to them II. helps in resource planning: the model should include branch level bank data III. grants insight on the current performance of the branches Together with the external consultant who assigned me to the project, we have made the decision, that as the target variable, I should re-estimate the real performance of banking products of which it is not possible to estimate raw market demand. The proposed system uses the original inputs of the bank, and the microlocation level data collected by the company I am working for. The modeling happened in R, and the visualization happened using Tableau. The key takeaway while defining the scope was, that sometimes the consultancy business meets with unmatcheable client expectanceies, and it is hard to both provide a scientficly correct solution, and fits a budget. Even while just internally rewamping the project, I met several times the comment: „you are not rigth abot the solution being incorrect, it met the client’s needs, and it has been paid, I don’t even know why you still care about that”. In my perspective, currently consultancy businesses (at least in big4 companies) do not utilize the data assets given properly, and it is hard to interpret something more complex than an excel sheet. After successfully defining the scope of the project, I started the data collection from the previous project. Cleaning the data is alwasy a demanding task. The main challenge was the format here: overformatted excel tables are not compatible with statistical softwares. Data cleaning was must struggle. After consulting with an subject matter expert, I selected the features, and cleaned the data. The result ended up being a „wide” dataset, with not too many rows, but a lot of feature variables. When the data was ready, the first decision I had to make was to use time series model or cross-section model. Essentially, the problem statement would suggest time series analysis, to predict next year’s possible sales number for each product, however during data collection research, I realized, that there is no available yearly data on microlocation level, only just for a few parameters. Therefore I decided, that I have train a cross section model, and performance analysis will happen based on a re-prediction of the existing sales data in the cross-section. For the analysis I will separate the dataset into two parts: the training (70% of the data) and the test set (30% of the data). I will train the algorithms on the training set, and will run them on the test set. I will chose between the two algorithms based on the Residual Mean Squared Error calculated on the test set. In this case, when I created the test and the data set, I made sure, that I will divide according their proportions the Budapest brancehs (70% of the Budapest branches are assigned to the training, 30% of the Budapest branches are assigned test set). In a normal scenario random sampling would be beneficitial, but with this low amount of data rows, I wanted to make sure, that neither the training or the test set is disorted based on that feature. After the train and the test set was created, I had to decide which algorithm I should use. For wide datasets, I had to decide to use algorithms, that are robust to noise, and perform a careful fature selection. Therefore, I have chosen elastic net, with both boostrapping and crossvalidation methods, and extreme gradient boosting to compare. While using elastic net, the algorithm that I have known from my studies with both setups, it was exciting to see to receive the expected differencences from both variation. I expected to receive more endogenous, but fewer variables, and more numerous, but less likely endogenious variables from crossvalidation methodogoly. Learning extreme gradient boosting was challenging, new, exciting experience. Testing both algorithms on the training set I received no significant difference, in some cases one or other performed better. Since interpretation of the coefficients had a high priority during this project, I decided to use elastic net for the final predictions. To properly interpret the model, I decided to use Tableau for data visualization. These visulaizations are focusing on the representation of the findings of the underlying analysis. The visulaziation was created in the form of 3 tableau dashboards for each target product. All 3 dashboard have 4 main elements: I. Map, that indicates performance of the banking product: • For each branch, a circle is allocated based on GPS coordinates. The bigger the circle is, the bigger the absolute difference is between the predicted and the actual value. The color indicates the relative difference between the predicted value and the actual value, compared to the original value. Red indicates negative difference, blue indicates positive difference. relative and absolute differences are added as a calculated column in tableau. • The map has two actions: o Hover: hovering on the circle of a branch will visualize all the properties of the branch o Select: selecting branch(es) will cause their name to reveal on the map. Only the selected branches will be present in the two bar charts below the map II. 2 side-by-side column charts: the top side-by-side chart shows the 3 most important local feature that has a positive effect on sales by the name of the branch, the bottom one shows the 3 most important local feature that has negative effect on sales. By default it shows all the branches, selection on the map effects both side-by-die column charts III. imported picture from R showing the feature importance for each product Currently there is two other action on the dashboard that can be taken: filter by relative performance using the slide, and a manual selector for brancehs. The proof of concept system I created selected the most important features for 3 core banking producst. During modeling, I have succesfully trained the algorithms to show partial effects of both branch and local properties. With the help of tableau visualization, I also granted insight how well branches are performing. However providing descriptive analytics and key findings regarding the product sales would be insightful, it has no real business value in this scenario, therefore it is out of the scope of the project. The inmediate use of this proof of concept is quite obvious: if the given bank would open a new branch anywhere in the country, my company would easily provide consultancy for them, both resource and financial product target allocation could happen inmediately. The next step would be to fully automate the solution, that only requires minor finetuning. The only input it would require is the data table from a new bank containing their branch level data The further improvement of the project would be to sell itt o an another bank, ith would strenghten our inner database with more sales data, and the algorithm could be retrained with more data points. Also it would be helpful, to channel in their own key painpoints, and further develop both the code and the dashboard. In general, I can conclude, that data based consultancy is not just the future, but the present. Even this capstone project offers more insightful analysis for the retail banking client, than the previous solution that was created under 6 months by 4 people. Firms, who do not invest in data science capabilities will slowly lose their market potential.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (932k)', 'Local note': 'Capstone  project', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The Communist policies could bring the aimed result since they were very aggressive, miss implemented or even not served the interest of Roma at all. However, the Communist systems had one positive common feature by which the Roma could be more integrated after the regime change: It was the policy which made the work obligatory, resulting in high employment rate among Roma. As a result, the working class of Roma people was much broader than today and could afford to be more integrated to the society. Next to many other Hungarian public policies, I have found that the Public Work Program (PWP) is one of the possible ways to change the socio-economic status of Roma. Although the program in itself is still missing many elements to be effective, just like in case of the previous policies. I suggest six alternative ways to improve the current performance: a, Ensure temporary employment; b, Provide income support; c, Encourage on the job employment search; d, Combine with training and skill accumulation; e, Establish an independent evaluator institution; f, Produce for real goods market. Out of these ways, I consider a, and f, as the most implementable since the infrastructures are already built up, and thus there is no need for a huge financial cost.

After a brief summary of accounting terms and problem statement, the Capstone project offers a solution by the development of an automated wing-to-wing reconciliation: daily automatic ETL scripts consolidate batch data from BOXi, OBIEE, and manual sources. These are stored in a Microsoft SQL Server environment, where triggers and stored procedures create a detailed, order-level view on reconciliation status. This automation and simplification has an important effect on quality and saves around 21 hours for the team while providing daily visibility on movements, instead of the once-per-quarter approach of the previous process. From the reconciliation view, an R script trains an XGBoost model on the data and predicted probabilities are assigned to the binary classes based on the sample mean threshold of the occurrence of open items within the data, resulting in an overall accuracy of 94% in differentiating them from recorded items.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (155k)', 'Local note': 'Capstone project', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Applying these techniques, we find that a vast majority of the variables of interest retained their underlying relationships with the probability of the first default, or Chapter 11. However, as we extrapolate these techniques to predicting repeated default, or Chapter 22, we discover that fundamental characteristics, such as profitability and leverage, play a considerably larger role than equity-market factors for reorganized firms. Finally, we extend both Shumway`s and Campbell`s specifications by incorporating macroeconomic and industry factors. We conclude that both are significant predictors of Chapter 11; in contrast, firms that remain distressed after being restructured tend to default irrespectively of the economic cycle.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1066k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

It had to be signed by every student who wanted to pursue his/her studies in the Hungarian universities (on a fully-funded or partially state-funded status). The reason behind the introduction of the policy action was that the government wanted to decrease the number of those people who leave the country after finishing their state-financed studies. The main point of the contract was if one attends a university in Hungary in a not self-funded form, he/she has to work in Hungary after the studies for a certain period and if one refuses this condition and wants to work abroad he/she has to pay back the cost of studies. Meanwhile, the government implemented another action at the same time. It cut down the number of state-financed programs which was an incomprehensive action not only for the future university students and for universities as institutions either. The paper examines the period between 2006-2016. In my paper, I examined the effect of the two abovementioned policy measures. I looked for the answer to my hypothetical questions: 1. Was there any effect on the number of applications when the Hungarian government introduced the student contract and reduced the number of fully-funded places at the university? 2. Were there different effects on the different programs? 3. Was there any difference in the number of applications among students with a different background? For the analysis, I used the database of “Felvi” which I received from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. I found that the two measures affected on the applications. The number of applications to the state-financed places was decreased from 2011 to 2012 and this declining trend could be also observed in the number of applicants. Based on my analysis I formulated 3 recommendations. The first, Hungary should invest more in its higher education system. My second finding is that students should apply where they would like to. The system should not restrict them in their choice. My last finding is, there has to be done some modification to the language exam system because this source of extra admission points increases the differences among applicants with a different socio-economic background.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2281k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Negative effects of crowdwork on wages have been measured in the USA and in the EU, but very few studies have looked at the labor market effects in the context of developing economies, and especially at the country level. Based on the ILO Crowdwork survey and the NSSO Periodic Labor Force Survey in India, this thesis compares the hourly wages of workers in digital labor platforms to those with similar characteristics in the traditional labor force and investigates whether working on microtask platforms has any effect on the workers’ earnings and working conditions. The results of the OLS and 2SLS models suggest that the microtask platforms lead to lower wages and more precarious working conditions in the country in 2017 when domestic work is used as an instrumental variable.

On average, the program also had positive spill-over effects on untreated education stages.

Decarbonisation has become one of the main priorities for governments and corporations all around the world, who are joining the efforts to contribute their share to the transition towards a low or carbon neutral economy. For corporations the transition to low carbon operations is a difficult and complex task that is bound to many challenges including economical viability and technological feasibility.  According to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Keeping below 2�C requires peaking global GHG emissions before 2020 and that the emissions in 2050 are at least 49% to 72% below the level of emissions in 2010. According to the 2014 report of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, over 93 trillion USD in financing will be needed for the transition to low carbon economy over the next 15 years.  The green finance market is undeniably on a rise, supported by a strong push by the policy makers and key finance market stakeholders. The options for financing the transformation for a low carbon economy are widening and companies should maximize their benefit from this development.  As of 2018, the investments into low carbon transformations are not just fundamentally needed (to ensure the survival of planet), but also required by the policy (as a result of ambitious climate goals by 198 states signing the Paris Agreement) and economically sensible ( saving costs, contributing to portfolio and business risk management, increasing profitability, enabling to benefit from favourable conditions of green financing).  The role of the money market is to enable access to financing for those companies, who acknowledge and choose to follow these trends.  Depending on the aim, size of required financing, business cycle and optimal capital structure companies can choose from various types of financing. Green equity, green bonds and green loans are showing an impressive growth in the past few years. With the country level climate ambitions the state subsidies increase in significant amounts and world spread carbon market mechanisms contribute in financing by efficient climate finance allocation. Interest in financing the low carbon transformation is even spreading beyond the money market, to private participants via crowdfunding and crowd investment platforms.  The access to green financing is still in a development stage. To maximize the impact of green finance, the companies first have to be aware of the available variants, choose wisely and make sure to comply with the eligibility criteria. In each case, green finance provides valuable financing opportunities and should be considered by companies who contribute to the transition to a low carbon economy.  The aim of this project is to provide a simplified overview about the emerging opportunities on the green finance market for private sector.  The project tackles 4 key questions: How does the global green finance market work? What are the main sources of green financing available and what are their main features?

Compiled dissimilarity measures show a high amendment activity, but with a considerable variation across bills and legislative cycles. By applying regression analysis, we investigate how bills’ characteristics and MPs’ strategic effort influence the extent of bills’ change.

To answer this question we create a novel measure of household exposure to economic policy uncertainty news by combining survey information on the hours a household spends in reading newspapers and the frequency of such news in the popular press during a household’s pre-interview period. After controlling for household fixed effects, month-year fixed effects and time-varying cognitive skills, we find that households with more exposure to economic policy uncertainty news are less likely to invest in stocks directly or through mutual funds. This effect is independent from the VIX and household stock-price expectations.  Chapter 2: The Relative Importance of Taste Shocks and Price Movements in the Variation of Cost of Living: Evidence from Barcode Data  Intertemporal consumer preference shifts, although common in modern macroeconomic models as drivers of demand shocks, have important but largely unexplored implications for price index theory and thus, for empirically measured price changes. The current practice of inflation measurement basically ignores taste changes and this study aims to fill in this gap. We derive a cost-of-living index in the presence of intertemporal preference shifts and show that such taste changes tend to lower the cost of living. Using a large barcode level dataset that covers 331 product groups and ten countries, we then uncover the importance of taste changes in explaining consumer demand shifts across close substitutes. We also analyze how measured consumer price inflation alters after allowing for taste adjustment over time and under CES preferences. To do so, we estimate the elasticity of substitution between varieties of the same good and use those to calculate goods price indexes. Our results show that the median elasticity of substitution is around 4 and we find that the average annual goods price inflation is on average about 1.1 percentage points lower when taking into account consumer taste shifts compared to standard goods price indexes. Our results indicate that taste changes are an important hitherto ignored factor in the measurement of cost of living changes.  Chapter 3: A Model of Trade in Used Durable Goods  This chapter examines the role of secondary markets in durable goods in cross-country trade dynamics, with a special focus on the car industry. It contributes to the literature by providing a better understanding of the drivers of high trade volatility in durable goods. Empirically, it documents patterns in new and used car trade flows for a sample of European Union countries. Further, it develops a two-country general equilibrium model of trade in which countries can trade on the various vintages of a durable good. Countries can differ in their initial endowment, growth rate in the car sector and the representative household's preference for new versus older vintages. Adjustment in the level and age composition of the car stock can occur by new car production or international trade. This relationship is responsible for the dynamics of the model. Trade patterns are determined by comparative advantages. The model predicts that the country that experiences a high growth rate in new car production has comparative advantage in new cars and becomes a new car exporter. Further, the country that dislikes old cars relatively less will consume used cars and export new cars. Cross-country differences in tastes and growth rate in new car production influence cross-country trade dynamics. A sudden negative supply shock triggers stock adjustment in the country hit by the shock which generates large initial trade flows and muted but persistent trade flows thereafter. The chapter presents a numerical example and simulation results for the model that uses parameters calibrated to the primary and secondary car market in Germany and Hungary."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2171k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The first chapter explores the effect of the disability quota-levy system. The chapter concludes that firms react sensitively to the financial incentive, however, low effective labor supply hampers the effectiveness of the quota regulation. The second chapter focuses on the effects of earnings limit accompanied to disability benefits and it demonstrates that a low earnings limit might reduce earnings and employment rate of partially disabled beneficiaries. The third chapter (with Gábor Oblath) investigates the relationship between economic growth and real exchange rate misalignment within the European Union, using panel econometric techniques. In this essay we find that deviation in the price level of GDP and the internal relative price from levels consistent with economic development affects economic growth in the EU and analyze the role of different factors influencing this effect. Chapter 1: Effect of employment tax incentives: the case of disability quota in Hungary  The first chapter evaluates the effect of the Hungarian disability quota - levy system on disabled employment and firm behavior, and also aims to shed light on factors influencing the effectiveness of employment tax incentives. According to the quota rule, firms above a certain size threshold, have to employ at least five percent disabled employees or pay a levy in case of non-compliance. The special feature of the Hungarian quota system is the uniquely high levy, which is accompanied by poor labor market integration of the disabled. The estimation exploits two significant policy changes: the drastic increase in the levy in 2010 and the increase in the firm size threshold from 20 to 25 employees in 2012. The policy effect on disabled employment is estimated on firm level data with regression discontinuity design (RDD). The baseline RDD results are adjusted to account for the potential bias arising from non-random firm selection, as many firms adjust their size to avoid the quota. The estimated disabled employment effect is high in international comparison, however, almost three-quarter of the quota is not fulfilled. I find evidence that the ratio of disabled population influences the disabled employment effect of the quota. This suggests that low effective labor supply is a factor behind low quota fulfillment.  Chapter 2: Earnings limit for disability benefits: is it really a cash-cliff?  The second chapter aims to evaluate the effect of disability benefit earnings limits on labor supply of moderately disabled individuals. Earnings limits accompanied to disability benefits are often blamed for their negative work incentive, though their impact on labor supply is ambiguous even a priori and the empirical evidence is mixed. This paper adds to this debate by analyzing the effect of a policy reform which decreased the earnings ceiling accompanied to the main benefit of moderately disabled persons in Hungary, the regular social assistance (RSA), from 80% of the pre-disability wage to 80% of the statutory minimum wage. The impact of tighter restrictions is estimated in a regression discontinuity (RD) design and in a difference in difference (DiD) framework, using administrative data. Both RD and DiD results confirm that the lower earnings ceiling has not induced more beneficiaries to exit the benefit and take a job paid above the new limit. However, it reduced both earnings and employment of beneficiaries. The results suggest that the substitution effect dominates the income effect in labor supply reactions to the new earnings limit. The results suggest that the substitution effect dominates the income effect the labor supply reactions to the new wage limit. Despite the low wage ceiling and the low amount of the benefit, many RSA recipients choose staying below the threshold rather than leaving the benefit and take a better paid job under the stricter wage restrictions, resulting in discontinuously lower income of new entrants. Chapter 3: Economic growth and real exchange rate misalignments in the European Union  (joint with Gábor Oblath)  In this chapter we investigate the relationship between economic growth and real exchange rate (RER) misalignments within the European Union (EU) during the period 1995-2016. In addition to the relative price level of GDP, we quantify an alternative indicator for the RER: the internal relative price of services to goods. We interpret RER-misalignments as deviations from levels consistent with levels of economic development among EU countries. Using pooled OLS and dynamic panel techniques, we find that within the EU over- (under-) valuations, both in the relative price level of GDP and the internal relative price indicator are associated with lower (higher) growth. This is mainly due to developments in countries operating under fixed exchange rate regimes. Our results indicate that the level of development does not influence the strength of the growth-misalignment relationship within the EU. Regarding the price level of GDP, we find that the positive relationship between undervaluation and growth diminishes with the degree of undervaluation. We find that overvaluation has a statistically significant negative effect on export market shares and private investments, indicating that both the competitiveness and the investment channels play a role in the relationship between growth and RER misalignments. The policy implications of the analysis point to the importance of a growth strategy avoiding overvaluation on the one hand, and to the futility of aiming at excessive undervaluation, on the other.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

The main message of Chapter 1 is that campaigning on highly divisive, identity-based issues can serve as a cheaper alternative to provision of goods and services, so politicians have an economic incentive to cater to hardliners. I formalize and test this hypothesis using Indonesian data. About half of the district governments in Indonesia have been experimenting with divisive and often controversial Sharia-based religious policies since 2000. I estimate the impact of religious policies using difference-in-differences and instrumental variables methods. I show that districts that introduce Sharia policies spend less and create less public services: the conservative estimate of the impact is a 10 percent decrease in both spending and in the value of a standardized government services index. The downstream social effects of cutting service provision and relying on hardliners to win elections are that Sharia policies increase various measures of poverty and foster violence. Model-based welfare calculations suggest that the utility loss of the secular voters is even larger than observed outcomes would suggest. In Chapter 2 (joint with with Pawel Bukowski, Gregory Clark and Rita Pető) we study the long-run social mobility in Hungary from the late 18th until early 21th century. We measure social mobility using the relative representation of various social groups (identified by surnames) among elite occupations. Using unique historical registries spanning more than two centuries, we are able to estimate the rate of status transmission under different political regimes: feudal and constitutional monarchies (-1918), right-wing authoritarianism (1919-1945), communism (1947-1989) and liberal democracy (1989-). We show that social mobility on the group level is slow. It is faster in regimes that were liberal by the standard of their age (constitutional monarchy and liberal democracy), and slower under right-wing authoritarianism. Surprisingly, we find very limited evidence for accelerating social mobility under communism. Finally, disadvantaged groups that we are able to identify by surname (such as the Romani minority) do not see any meaningful improvement of their status under any of the studied regimes.  In Chapter 3 we study (with Rita Pető) the name changing movement of the late 19th and the early 20th century Hungary using unique, individual level data on family name “Hungarianizations”. We argue that self-selection into name changing, which was an important step in the assimilation process, was at least partly driven by economic incentives from the government's part. Making use of a historical policy shock which involved a one-year campaign among public sector workers to Hungarianize their names, we show evidence that the observed patterns in name changing are consistent with economic self-selection into assimilation, and quantify how much of the variation in name changing is driven by the static and dynamic push effect of policy, and how much is explained by the pull effect of community ties. We find that name changing responds to changes in incentives quite quickly, which is surprising given the results of previous studies on cultural persistence."", 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (4841k)'}"

The third chapter (joint work with Kinga Marczell) uses a Hungarian administrative data set and shows how managers’ career path are differentially affected by a health shock compared to the career path of non-managers. Chapter 1 - I Gain, You Mitigate This paper examines whether people distort beliefs about third parties – such as the ability of scientists to offset one’s environmental impact – to excuse self interested behavior. I set up a lab experiment in which dictators decide how much money to take, with the success of a third party in solving a puzzle determining whether the money comes from passive participants or another source. The experiment exogenously varies whether it is the success or the failure of the third party that results in taking the chosen amount from passive participants. After participants decide the amount, they report their beliefs about the success of the third party. I find that the proportion of participants believing in the success of the third party is 13 percentage points higher when the success of the third party results in taking the money from a different source. With monetary incentives for correct beliefs, this effect goes down to 6 percentage points and becomes insignificant. This means that the presence of a third party might result in even more self-interested behavior than it has been previously thought.  Chapter 2 - Holding a Portfolio and Wishful Thinking with Balázs Krusper This paper investigates whether people distort their beliefs about ambiguous outcomes of products as a result of owning them. We set up a lab experiment where people have to form beliefs about portfolios’ payoff probabilities. The experiment exogenously varies whether the good, or the bad portfolio is assigned to the subject. We find that beliefs about the payoff probabilities are 2.75 pp higher for assigned portfolios and this effect is significant on a one- sided test. The study also tests for asymmetric belief updating, effects of changing payoff size, and changes in incentives for correct guessing. We find neither sign of differential belief updating, nor an effect of changes in incentives for guessing correctly. When the amount the portfolio pays off is increased, there is less of an effect of owning it. This is hard to reconcile with the current theories, however, disappointment aversion might be a plausible explanation.  Chapter 3 - The Effect of Managers’ Health Shocks on their Future Employment with Kinga Marczell Using Hungarian administrative data set, this study analyzes the effect of a health shock on employment outcomes – such as wage and employment. Distinguishing managers, we estimate interaction effects as well. A health shock results on average 45pp permanent drop in the likelihood of employment starting one year after the event, and a temporary drop in wages. The likelihood of employment for managers, however, are affected 5.5pp less and their wages experience a moderate drop lasting even after the health shock.

Although questions are vaguely related: transmission of financial shocks, effects of labour supply shock, and drivers of corporate charitable giving; all three chapters share similar methodological approach: applying microeconometric methods to test hypothesis derived from economic theory. The contribution of the thesis consists of providing new empirical evidence to existing questions, first and second chapter, or tackling questions that have not been yet analysed in the literature: the third chapter. The main contribution of the first chapter lies in a better measurement of a variable of interest, for which previous studies did not have available data, and had to use approximation. Second chapter follows identification strategy that is well-known in literature, but in a setting of developing country and specific episode. Extending the methodology to different settings contributes to the literature by providing evidence for the external validity of the hypothesis: that the results found in one setting hold in other settings too. Last but not least, the third chapter compares donation behaviour of foreign and domestic firms, topic that has not been studied yet, using quantitative approach on a big sample of firms. Previous studies were by business or sociology scholars, conducted on a small sample of firms, and descriptive in nature.  The first chapter aims to answer the question if foreign banks deleveraged from Central and Eastern Europe (CESEE) during the European Sovereign debt crisis. High interest rates and relatively low indebtedness of households led foreign banks to form subsidiaries and enter CESEE markets. The subsidiaries relied to a great extent on a funding from the parent bank. Parent banks could borrow cheaply in their home markets and then transfer funds in form of loans or equity to their CESEE subsidiaries. However, the Eurozone crisis put an end to this business model. The crisis inflicted losses on parent banks and led to deterioration of capital position. Due to unfavourable market conditions, banks were unable to raise new equity and had to reduce the assets in order to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. Analysts and financial press raised concerns that bank will withdraw funds from CESEE and provoke credit crunch in the region. To examine if this really happened I collect data on related party transactions from the annual financial statements of subsidiaries. The data on related party transactions is not part of any commercial database, so related literature could provide only indirect evidence for the transmission of financial shock from Eurozone to CESEE.  The second chapter examines the effects of refugee influx during Yugoslav wars on the municipal labor markets. Arrival of refugees represents “natural experiment”, allowing for clean identification of the effects of labor supply shock. Arrival of refugees was motivated by political and not economic factors which eases endogeneity concerns. Moreover, arrival occurred in a short period of time, and was substantial in size, which decreases the likelihood that the effects are driven confounding factors, and not by refugee arrival.  The third chapter analyses charitable donations spending of domestic and foreign firms in Serbia. The question if foreign firms donate more than domestic firms has not been posed so far in the economics literature, and this chapter provides valuable insights by analysing unique dataset of Serbian firms. Uniqueness of the dataset stems from the fact that firms registered in Serbia had to report donations expenses in their annual financial statements, which is not the case in other countries. Hence, previous studies of corporate charitable donations had to rely on a survey or industry-level aggregated data from the tax authorities.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

Chapter 1 Using a linked dataset of frontpages of The New York Times observed multiple times a day and browsing data, I measure the effect of the po- sitions of news articles on the popularity of news articles. In a simple multinomial logit framework with article fixed effects I am able to iden- tify position effects from within article differences of positions across frontpages. Focusing on the vertical positioning, I estimate a negative and decreasing strength effect of article position. The magnitude of the estimated effects is large: an article positioned in the top versus the sec- ond positions all else being equal results in 26 to 44 percent higher view share for the upper position. In a counterfactual exercise, I find a con- servative mean increase of 5 percent on click-through rate resulting from solely reordering some articles on the frontpage. Furthermore, the actual ordering observed in the data is closer to a random ordering than to the counterfactual optimum. These findings point to the possibly enormous influence of editorial decisions on what people read in newspapers. Chapter 2 A policy debate centers around the question whether news aggregators such as Google News decrease or increase traffic to online news sites. One side of the debate, typically espoused by publishers, views aggre- gators as substitutes for traditional news consumption because aggre- gators’ landing pages provide snippets of news stories and therefore reduce the incentive to click on the linked articles. Defendants of ag- gregators, on the other hand, view aggregators as complements because they make it easier to discover news and therefore drive traffic to pub- lishers. This debate has received particular attention in the European Union where two countries, Germany and Spain, enacted copyright re- forms that allow newspapers to charge aggregators for linking to news snippets. In this paper, we use Spain as a natural experiment because Google News shut down all together in response to the reform in De- cember 2014. We compare the news consumption of a large number of Google News users with a synthetic control group of similar non-Google News users. We find that the shutdown of Google News reduces over- all news consumption by about 20% for treatment users, and it reduces page views on publishers other than Google News by 10%. This de- crease is concentrated around small publishers while large publishers do not see significant changes in their overall traffic. We further find that when Google News shuts down, its users are able to replace some but not all of the types of news they previously read. Post-shutdown, they read less breaking news, hard news, and news that is not well covered on their favorite news publishers. These news categories explain most of the overall reduction in news consumption, and shed light on the mech- anisms through which aggregators interact with traditional publishers. Chapter 3 This paper studies a value function iteration algorithm based on nonex- pansive function approximation and Monte Carlo integration that can be applied to almost all stationary dynamic programming problems. The method can be represented using a randomized fitted Bellman opera- tor and a corresponding algorithm that is shown to be globally conver- gent with probability one.

Each chapter employs theoretical and empirical approaches to investigate a different aspect of the effect of trade policies on the economy. In the first two chapters, I focus on Hungarian manufacturing firms, and in the third chapter, I focus on US product-level exports to 119 countries. In the first chapter, I study the effects of import competition faced by Hungarian manufacturing firms during the period 1996-2003 on their efficiency. I start by arguing that existing methods of estimating productivity cannot be applied in my setting. So, I proposed a new framework for estimating physical productivity and study the effects of import competition on the productivity of firms.  In the second chapter, I challenge the conventional assumption of production with a constant marginal cost using matched manufacturing firm-product-destination dataset from Hungary. I show that when a firm faces an exogenous export demand shock, the firm scales down its domestic sales in order to increase its exports and this effect persists even after taking longer differences of exports and domestic sales, suggesting the presence of production capacity constraints. To investigate whether this finding is innocuous for welfare, I introduce an increasing marginal cost structure in a traditional trade model and show a new channel for welfare losses from trade liberalization.  In the third chapter, I study the relationship between an improvement in intellectual property rights (IPR) in a country and the industry exports it receives from the US using product-level panel datasets of US exports to 119 countries during the period 1989-2006. I show both theoretically and empirically that an improvement in patent laws is associated with an increase in US exports, and industry-level product life-cycle length determines the sensitivity of US exports to IPR reforms.  Chapter 1: Quality-Adjusted Productivity and The Effect of Trade Liberalization on Productivity.  In this chapter, I study the effects of the reduction in import tariffs charged on EU imports in Hungary during the periods (1996-2003) on the efficiency of Hungarian manufacturing firms. Since I do not observe firm-level output quantity, I propose a structural framework that enables me to estimate quantity productivity from revenue data. This framework involves integrating the demand systems faced by a firm in both the foreign and domestic markets with the firm's production function, and by this, I derive a new structural estimable equation that estimates quantity productivity. Using a matched firm-product level datasets and product tariffs, and applying the structural methodology, I find that a 10-percentage point reduction in average tariffs faced by a firm raises firm level quantity productivity by 0.97 percent and revenue productivity by 2.1 percent. This large differences between revenue and quantity productivity imply that revenue productivity overstates the effects of trade liberalization and calls for re-evaluations of numerous studies that have attributed large efficiency gains to trade liberalization. In addition, I offer a more general framework that can be easily applied to estimating firm-level physical productivity from revenue data when firms sell in both domestic and export markets.   Chapter 2: Increasing Marginal Cost and Welfare Implications  In this chapter, I use a matched firm-product-destination dataset for manufacturing firms in Hungary and exploit the exogenous variations in the foreign demand addressed to a firm using an instrumental variable approach and a structural methodology to study the relationship between a firm's domestic and foreign sales while controlling for the firm's supply determinants. I find that a 10 percent exogenous increase in foreign sales leads to approximately 1.6 percent decrease in domestic sales. This finding suggests the presence of an increasing marginal cost of production, contrary to the assumption of constant marginal costs in most trade models. To shed some lights on the implications of our findings for aggregate welfare, I introduce an increasing marginal cost technology into a traditional trade model and show that liberalizing trade results to a new channel of reductions in potential welfare gains not accounted for in previous studies. Thus, it implies that the constant marginal cost assumption in trade models is not innocuous. As increasing marginal costs is a consequence of capacity constraints at the firm level (Ahn and McQuiod 2016), the findings provide support for concurrent policies that reduce trade barriers and eases capacity constraints in order to ensure the full realization of gains from trade.  Chapter 3: Exports and Intellectual Property Policies: Does Product Life-Cycle Length Matter? In this chapter, I ask the following questions: How do US exports in the high technology sector react to a change in intellectual property rights (IPR) reforms in destination countries? What determines the industry sensitivity of exports to IPR reforms? To answer these questions, I build a partial equilibrium model where a profit-maximizing firm in the North has acquired patents on its output and then, decides when and which countries to export. Countries are heterogeneous in their level of IPR regulation, imitation risk, and economic size. The firm faces a trade-off between market expansion and market power. By exporting to all countries, the firm increases its sales and profit but faces the risk of imitation on its output which robs it of its market power. The model predicts that: strengthening IPR laws in countries in the South leads to increased exports especially in sectors with relatively longer product life-cycle length. However, this relationship is non-monotonic as products in sectors at the topmost distribution of product life-cycle length are less sensitive to stricter IPR reforms compare to sectors at the median. I use yearly panel datasets (1989-2006) consisting of US product-destination information, country-level IPR index and cross-sectional product life-cycle length data to test the predictions of the model. I find our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of the model. The results point to the importance of IPR policies in determining sectoral patterns of trade flows between countries."", 'Local note': 'PDF file (1674k)', 'Access': 'DOI: 10.14754/CEU.2018.12', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The second chapter, co-authored with Emil Verner, analyzes how a financial crisis affects political preferences. The third, single-authored chapter analyzes the effect of a financial crisis on student outcomes. Chapter 1 studies the impact of monetary conditions on the supply of mortgage credit by banks to households. Using a comprehensive supervisory dataset from Hungary, we first establish a “bank-lending-to-households” channel by showing that monetary conditions affect the supply of mortgage credit in volume. We then study the impact of monetary conditions on the composition of mortgage credit along its currency denomination and borrower risk. We find that expansionary domestic monetary conditions increase the supply of mortgage credit to all households in the domestic currency and to risky households in the foreign currency. Because most households are unhedged, bank lending in multiple currencies may involve additional risk taking. Changes in foreign monetary conditions affect lending in the foreign currency more than in the domestic currency, but do not trigger compositional changes in the risk exposures of the banks. Chapter 2 studies the effect of the 2008 financial crisis on the vote share of the populist far right. We use the foreign currency borrowing of households in Hungary as a natural experiment. During the crisis the unexpected and large depreciation of the domestic currency increased the debt burden of households borrowing in foreign currencies but not of households borrowing in the local currency. We use zip code level variation in the prevalence of foreign currency borrowing of households, and show that the exposure to the depreciation significantly affected political preferences. A 10 percent unanticipated rise in indebtedness increased the vote share of the far right by 2.2 percentage points. This effect explains one third of the increase of their popularity by the 2010 election. Foreign currency debtors\' na\\""{i}vet\\\'{e}, persistent extremist attitudes, local labor market shocks, and immigration do not account for this increase.

Chapter 3 studies how households\' financial distress affected the student development. I focus on the 2008 financial crisis, I use household foreign currency credit expansion as a natural experiment in Hungary. During the crisis the exchange rate shock increased the debt burden of households borrowing in foreign currencies but not of households borrowing in the local currency. I measure exposure to the depreciation at the zip code level by using credit registry data. I use administrative student level standardized test scores at the zip code level. My identification strategy compares the development of students attending the same class but living in different zip codes. I find that a 10 percent unexpected debt shock decreases the math and reading skills by .045 standard deviation.

The new ways of data management, the comprehensive registry of transactions and other activities, and the attempts at the international harmonization of the data lead to the massive presence and direct accessibility of multi-dimensional panels.  The econometrics of standard, two-dimensional panel data is well-developed: it has been the subject of practically limitless research in the past fifty-sixty years. As much as efforts devoted to two-dimensional panels are admirable, multi-dimensional panels challenge analysts in several new ways. First, two-way models and toolsets are usually insufficient to fully describe and address problems in this three-dimensional context, where the unobserved heterogeneity can take on several new and interesting forms. Second, various new or existent, but increasingly present, data-related issues emerge, like feasibility of the estimators due to the sheer size of the data, incompleteness of observations, variable index deficiencies, or the large number of economically feasible model specifications.  Despite the massive presence of multi-dimensional data sets, the econometrics of three-dimensional panels remains grossly underdeveloped. Luckily, an increasing number of econometricians understand its importance, and aid empiricists with menus of modelling techniques and estimators capable of extracting the excess information embedded in the data. This thesis contributes to the literature by collecting several appealing model formulations, fixed effects, random effects and varying coefficients models, and proposing suitable estimation techniques.

Each chapter investigates a specific societal or cultural driver of economic development in the historical context, using a unique, hand-collected dataset of more than a 1000 townships from historical Hungary of the 1869-1910 period. My research demonstrates the persistent influence of culture on economic outcomes, and also highlights the wealth of accessible and unexplored historical data for Central Europe. Chapter 1 is my job market paper. It studies the effects of population mixing on economic growth in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the most diverse country formation in modern European history. Based on the aforementioned self-compiled dataset, I find that ethnically and religiously diverse townships grew up to 20-60% faster in the 1880-1910 period than their homogeneous neighbors. These results are based on three different methodologies. First, OLS regressions take advantage of the largely random geographical patterns in diversity as a natural experiment. Second, endogeneity concerns are addressed by a novel IV strategy based on townships' previous exposure to warfare, using self-compiled data of more than 2000 military events dating back to the 15-17th centuries. Third, to understand the mechanism through which diversity translated to higher economic growth in an era of rapid industrialization, I develop a simple growth model that highlights the potential trade-offs between comparative productivity advantages and reduced knowledge spillovers diverse communities are likely to face. Empirical tests of the model's predictions confirm that diversity led to more diversified local economies, industrial sorting along ethnic and religious lines, as well as higher employment concentration in productive industries.  Chapter 2 proposes a new explanation for the historical source of Protestant economic prosperity based on the reformed institution of marriage and the modern family. Specifically, I argue that Calvin's insistence on spousal duty to love one another, rationalize the household, and educate children for the glory of God was instrumental in the emergence of the child-centered nuclear family and subsequent economic growth. The empirical analysis of the paper, based on the referenced township-level dataset from historical Hungary, confirms the economic progressiveness of puritan Calvinists relative to their Catholic or Lutheran neighbors, and attributes it to observed differences in marriage patterns, household size and fertility rates, both before and during the demographic transition. A simple model predicts that lower exogenous fertility preference can lead to higher per capita income when factors of production are fixed, consistent with the historical evidence of less crowded and fragmented use of agricultural land in Calvinist places.  Chapter 3 is a joint work with Miklós Koren. It studies the effects of railway roll-out on the spread of ideas and institutions in 19th-century Hungary. Specifically, we find that cultural commodities such as civil organizations, libraries, press outlets, coffee houses and theaters were highly concentrated in townships that had been connected to the railway network, to a much larger degree than what economic fundamentals would imply. By employing a series of different econometric approaches, we are able to identify railroads as important capillaries of institutional development. These results can serve as a starting point for developing and testing a simple model of behavioral contagion where the spatial characteristics of the railway network are explicitly accounted for, as well as for quantifying the effects of institutional development on economic growth at the local level."", 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (8743k)'}"

The first two chapters focus on why credit rating agencies failed to correctly assess the riskiness of innovative structured products, like those of collateralized debt obligations. The third chapter investigates how the introduction of retail structured products may lead to systematic patterns in aggregate retail investor behavior. The subprime crisis began to unfold when markets realized that structured products designed to be safe are, in fact, toxic. Credit rating agencies prolonged this misperception by granting triple-A credit ratings to many of these assets. In an applied game theoretic setting, I derive the conditions in Chapter 1 under which credit rating agencies operating in a duopoly, similarly to S&P and Moody's, are likely to provide overly optimistic assessments of risk. The main innovation of Chapter 1 is that I allow agencies to learn about each other's assessments during the rating process. Importantly, learning enables agencies to cater credit ratings, that is, offer a higher rating to a given issuer based on the other agency's more favorable assessment. Catering is harmful for social welfare as it reduces the informativeness of ratings. I show that the negative welfare implications of catering are most severe when the skewness of the rated assets' payoff is large, similarly to the payoffs of collateralized debt obligations. Chapter 2 builds on the framework of Chapter 1 and investigates how a rating agency calibrates its information technology as a response to changes in its business environment and also whether it has sufficient incentives to invest into information acquisition. I show that the agency's business environment has a strong effect on calibration and, in turn, on rating standards. Additionally, while the agency's ability to calibrate may have the benefit of alleviating conflicts of interests in the industry, when these conflicts are extreme, the agency chooses to ignore additional information about rated assets' quality. This helps to reconcile the empirical evidence documented in the literature on structured ratings, according to which agencies ignored valuable information that was available to them at the time they issued their ratings.  The third chapter is joint work with Kata Váradi and it focuses on retail structured products that are derivatives designed by banks for individual investors. Retail structured products became increasingly popular in the last decade as they enabled individual investors to trade with complex assets, that were previously not available to them. We analyze both empirically and theoretically a subset of these products, called knock-out warrants. Individuals can trade with knock-out warrants through stock exchanges and they allow individuals to place leveraged speculative bets in the market of their chosen underlying, like a stock index or a commodity. We show theoretically that in these markets individuals, on average, are likely to bet on price reversals, even if at the individual level investors randomly choose the direction of their respective bet. Using proprietary data from a bank, we provide supportive evidence for our prediction. We speculate that the setup of these markets may be beneficial for the banks if they need to hedge their own exposure to the underlying asset.   The results of my thesis suggest that the presence of innovative financial assets often affect the behavior of market participants. In particular, assets with highly skewed payoffs may change market outcomes in unforeseen ways. The skewed payoffs of collateralized debt obligations seem to have an adverse effect on rating agencies' incentives to exercise due diligence. On the other hand, the skewed payoffs of knock-out warrants results in unintentional but predictable aggregate behavior of individual investors."", 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1173k)'}"

The first chapter is an empirical one; it isolates the effect of the foreign currency on the loan performance of firms borrowing in different currencies in crisis time. I use a novel micro-level dataset from Hungary to decompose the factors contributing to the higher loan deterioration of foreign currency borrowers compared to local currency debtors. The results suggest that foreign currency denomination can increase the default probability considerably (even by 7 percentage points). Hence regulators should pay more attention to loans denominated in safe haven currencies, since they harm particularly in bad times. The second chapter is also empirical and is co-authored with Steven Ongena and Ibolya Schindele. It studies the impact of monetary policy on the supply of bank credit when bank lending is also denominated in foreign currencies. Accessing a comprehensive supervisory dataset from Hungary, we find that the supply of bank credit in a foreign currency is less sensitive to changes in domestic monetary conditions than the equivalent supply in the domestic currency. Changes in foreign monetary conditions similarly affect bank lending more in the foreign than in the domestic currency. Hence when banks lend in multiple currencies the domestic bank lending channel is weakened and international bank lending channels become operational.  The third chapter is a theoretical piece. It extends the standard global games framework by introducing an addition target on which agents can coordinate on. Global games are appropriate to model economic situations where agents have incentive to coordinate on some action, but due to incomplete information perfect coordination fails. I compare the multidimensional case to the standard global games problem. Furthermore, I investigate the effects of consolidating the multiple targets. I find that introducing an additional option generates a negative strategic correlation between the options and thus weakens the coordination. However, unifying the options eliminates the endogenous correlation and thus restores the coordination. I also show two potential applications to be modeled by the multidimensional global games framework.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (3863k)'}"

The first chapter (and the Job Market Paper) examines the effect on current student performance of the 19th century Partitions of Poland among Austria, Prussia and Russia. Despite the modern similarities of the three regions, using a regression discontinuity design I show that student test scores are 0.61 standard deviation higher on the Austrian side of the former Austrian-Russian border. On the other hand, I do not find evidence for differences on the Prussian-Russian border. Using a theoretical model and indirect evidence I argue that the Partitions have persisted through their impact on social norms toward local schools. Nevertheless, the persistent effect of Austria is puzzling given the historical similarities of the Austrian and Prussian educational systems. I argue that the differential legacy of Austria and Prussia originates from the Austrian Empire’s policy to promote Polish identity in schools and the Prussian Empire’s efforts to Germanize the Poles through education.  The second chapter is co-authored with Martyna Kobus. It studies the effect of threat of school competition on performance of public schools. We provide the evidence for the negative effect of the competition on students’ test scores in public schools. We use the introduction of the amendment facilitating the creation of autonomous schools in Poland in 2009 as a breakthrough date in DiD estimation. The specifics of the Polish reform provide for a credible proxy for the threat of competition, so we can take into account that the size of competition is endogenous to the market characteristics. For the total sample we find no effect, however, for more competitive urban educational markets, we report a drop in test scores in public schools following the introduction of the amendment. This negative effect is robust to the existence of some competition prior to the amendment and to the size of public schools. It does not result from the violation of the common trend assumption either. We focus on the short run in which there is only a limited set of actions available to schools’ principals. We exclude student sorting as a potential channel.  The third chapter estimates the effect of school competition on sorting within a school (across classes). The identification strategy is based on a two-stage design of the Polish Comprehensive Education, which allows to isolate an exogenous change in student mobility. In addition, I use a novel measure of student socio-economic characteristics - Raven’s Progressive Matrix test score. The results show that school competition leads to a higher sorting of students within a school and between schools. I investigate two explanation of the effect on sorting within a school: the demand for peer quality and the demand for teachers. The data point to the importance of the former mechanism, i.e. the demand for high quality peers that motivates school principals to create high tracks within a school.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (7983k)'}"

There are several well-known direct effects: foreign direct investment (FDI) creates new workplaces and increases tax revenue; trade increases both the market for domestic goods and the scope of goods available for local buyers. There is also evidence in the literature showing that exporting and importing firms become more productive. At the same time indirect effects are less trivial, though these can also be important. On one hand, indirect effects like knowledge spillovers or increased demand can benefit other local firms. On the other hand, competition for local inputs might also become higher. The three chapters of my thesis examine some of these indirect effects, both looking at their magnitude and the mechanism behind. In all three chapters I do an empirical analysis, using Hungarian firm-level panel data. In the first chapter I look for vertical FDI spillovers. Taking the large-scale investment of Audi in Hungary I find that local firms operating in the supplier industry increased their sales and employment after the Audi entry, which is in line with a local demand effect, but there is no evidence for increased productivity. Moreover, the demand effect is driven by firms with foreign owners, which might be the result of the large productivity gap between the domestic firms and Audi. In the second chapter I estimate the local spillovers of FDI exits. I find that sales and employment of local firms decreased after the closure of a foreign-owned large plant located nearby. I also provide evidence showing that decreased competition for local labor, decreased local purchasing power of the laid-off, and lost demand for local suppliers are all important channels in the plant closure effect. The third chapter is a joint work with \\'{A}d\\'{a}m Szeidl and Mikl\\'{o}s Koren. We estimate import spillovers, finding that peers with country-specific trade experience increase the probability of starting to import from a country. This effect is even stronger if the peer operates in the same industry or imported the same product before.  In my thesis I document several types of indirect effects of FDI and international trade. I show the existence of spillovers from an FDI to the supplier industry (chapter 1 and 2) and to the local service industry (chapter 2), and provide evidence for knowledge spillovers in imports (chapter 3). Additionally, I show that spillovers are specific to certain firm groups. All the three chapters suggest that spillovers are localized in space. Knowledge spillovers are especially concentrated in close neighborhoods. Spillovers are the strongest for firms in related industries: firms in the supplier industry of the foreign direct investment or same-industry peers of the importer firms. Finally, spillovers also depend on initial firm performance. Better firms tend to gain more after an FDI entry or learn more from experienced peers. Worse firms tend to lose more after an FDI exit."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (6897k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Educational outcomes are important factors of economic and social success. According to the human capital theory, individuals invest time and effort in their education for immediate and future gains. In the theoretical model of schooling investment and consumption decisions, one decides about how much time and effort to invest in learning maximizing the difference of the expected present value of lifetime wages and non-monetary benefits from schooling, and the actual costs of going to school and taking efforts. Both theoretical and empirical evidence show that such decision-making process may lead to lower-than-optimal schooling investment decisions, especially in the case of children of low socio-economic background, because they discount future returns more heavily, and also, learning may require more efforts from them. Educational policies can influence the production of educational outcomes through two main channels. First, they may aim to induce individuals to invest more into learning. Second, they can increase the productivity of the learning process within schools to produce higher outcomes. I examine examples to these two types of policy measures in my dissertation. In the first two chapters I estimate the impacts of increasing the compulsory school leaving (CSL) age in Hungary. CSL age legislation introduces a constraint into the mechanism in which one decides about how much time to invest in going to school. I make use of a legislation change that increased CSL age from 16 to 18. In the first chapter, I estimate the effects of increased CSL age on secondary school track choice which occurs at age 14 and secondary school dropout rates. I find that the legislation change resulted in an increased probability that children would choose the academic high school track instead of vocational training schools. At the same time, those choosing vocational training schools are more likely to drop out under the higher CSL age scheme. Potential explanations of increased dropout rates include a decrease in the quality of teaching in vocational training schools due to supply constraints, and a shift in student composition to include more students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The second chapter is a joint work with Flóra Samu and Ágota Scharle. We are looking at the effects of increased CSL age on the teenage fertility of Roma women, a disadvantaged ethnic minority in Hungary. We provide evidence that the legislation change decreased the probability of teenage motherhood among Roma women by 6.8 percentage points. This effect is temporary as higher CSL age delayed first birth-giving by two years. We exploit a unique database that covers live births, miscarriages, abortions, and still births, and contains information on the time of conception by weekly precision. We propose that the impact of the legislation change can be explained exclusively by the incapacitation effect of education, which keeps women physically in school: the higher CSL age decreases the probability of getting pregnant during the school year but not during summer and Christmas breaks. The third chapter, which is a joint work with Gábor Kézdi and Éva Surányi, considers educational policy from a different angle. It estimates the effects of a change in the technology of educational production within schools by looking at the OOIH demonstration program in Hungary. The program supported teachers and the management of schools with disadvantaged Roma students, mixed with non-Roma students, and aimed at helping the development of all students in an integrated school environment. We find that the program had significant positive effects on academic development (especially for Roma students), socio-emotional skills (in both ethnic groups), and inter-ethnic attitudes of non-Roma students. In my thesis I document that increasing the CSL age affects forward looking decision making about secondary school track choice, and impacts the distribution of students in school. I find that these effects are the strongest among children of low-educated parents. Furthermore, I provide evidence that higher CSL age can reduce teenage pregnancy solely through the incapacitation effect of being in school, even in a case when no human capital effects of education can be detected. Lastly, I document that a sensitive approach to the integrated education of Roma and non-Roma students is beneficial for all parties involved.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (7190k)', 'Access': 'DOI:  10.14754/CEU.2016.11', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The first chapter examines the effect of bonus payments on labor market fluctuations. A large share of workers receives bonus payments besides their base wage. The benefits of flexible wage components in remuneration are twofold: they can incentivize workers and make it easier to adjust wages downward in response to negative shocks. Using data on bonus payments of Hungarian workers from linked employer-employee data, I disentangle the importance of these two factors to assess their respective importance. First, I show that bonus payments flexibly adjust to the revenue shocks of firms. At the same time, the separation rate of workers without bonuses do not react more to revenue changes than the separation rate of workers with bonuses. Bonus paying firms are shown to be financially more stable, larger and more productive, and they have less volatile revenue than firms not paying bonuses. These facts are consistent with a wage posting model with incentive contracting, but they are hard to reconcile with models emphasizing the role of bonus payments in alleviating wage rigidity. These results indicate that wage flexibility regulations may not affect the employment responses of firms to negative shocks The second chapter is co-authored with Péter Elek, János Köllő and Péter András Szabó. In this chapter, we estimate a double-hurdle (DH) model of the Hungarian wage distribution assuming censoring at the minimum wage and wage under-reporting (i.e. compensation consisting of the minimum wage, subject to taxation and an unreported cash supplement). We estimate the probability of under-reporting for minimum wage earners, simulate their genuine earnings and classify them and their employers as ‘cheaters’ and ‘non-cheaters’. In the possession of the classification, we check how cheaters and non-cheaters reacted to the introduction of a minimum social security contribution base, equal to 200 per cent of the minimum wage, in 2007. The findings suggest that cheaters were more likely to raise the wages of their minimum wage earners to 200 per cent of the minimum wage, thereby reducing the risk of tax audit. Cheating firms also experienced faster average wage growth and slower output growth. The results suggest that the DH model is able to identify the loci of wage under-reporting with some precision. The third chapter is co-authored with Attila Lindner and it estimates welfare consequences of frontloading the unemployment benefit. In November 2005, the Hungarian government frontloaded the UI benefit path, while keeping constant the total benefit amount that could be collected over the UI spell. We estimate the effect of this reform on non-employment duration using an interrupted time series design. We find that non-employment duration falls by 1.5 weeks after November 2005. We show that this response is large enough to make the policy revenue neutral. Our evaluation for this reform is positive: frontloading increased job finding, did not make any unemployed worse off, and did not cost anything to the government.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2237k)'}"

Their major appeal is that they require minimum of information on the side of the regulator while the  efficient solution for achieving the environmental target is left in the care of market forces. This was  firstly shown by the seminal paper of Montgomery (1972), who demonstrated that in a system of tradable pollution permits, market equilibrium coincides with the cost-effective solution and this is independent of how permits are initially allocated to the regulated polluters. The current thesis contributes to the literature on the functioning of the emissions markets, with a focus on the role of auctioning as a method of initial allocation of permits. In three rather independent chapters, the thesis explores the eff ect of various market frictions on the outcome of an ETS. Speci fically, the  first chapter aims at the theoretical understanding of the eff ectiveness of an ETS in which permits are allocated in an auction followed by a secondary market, and all the ETS-regulated  firms exercise market power. Under these conditions the auction clearing price is below the secondary market price. In addition, the high emitters lose while the low emitters gain relative to the case when all fi rms take permits prices as given. However, if the polluters are not too diff erent in terms of their permits needs, strategic behavior can result in a lower overall compliance cost than in the case of price-taking behavior. In the second chapter I investigate the eff ect of uncertainty and the role of the speculators on the compliance behavior and pro ts of risk-averse regulated polluters. Contrary to the policy discussion which often ignores the presence of a secondary market when permits are allocated in an auction, the model of this paper shows that when the auction takes place under uncertainty, there will always be trade in the after-market. Moreover, the model shows how  firms take into account the possibility for trade when forming their bids in the auction. The model also demonstrates that, under the most realistic assumptions, the presence of the speculators adversely aff ects polluters pro ts, despite helping the regulator raise more revenue from selling permits. The third chapter searches for the behavioral bias of the sunk-cost fallacy in a laboratory experiment, in which the alternative course of action is explicitly given and part of the initial investment can be recouped. Conditional on subjects understanding the experimental task, I  find evidence of the manifestation of the bias, which, however, is independent of the size of the initial investment. Moreover, I fi nd that the higher cognitive ability subjects are more likely to exhibit the bias.

Within-firm variance constantly declined throughout the period while all changes in total wage dispersion are reflected in between-firm variance. This is to some extent explained by differences in within-cohort variances of new entrant firms. Half of the decline between 2000 and 2002 is explained by a 57 per cent increase in the real value of the minimum wage. Between 2002 and 2008, when measures on working hours are available, I do not find any evidence of working hours explaining trends in inequality of monthly earnings. Results do not change significantly when controlling for the changing size criteria of sample inclusion for companies across years. The contribution of changes in skill composition is around 30%, mainly due to the increasing dominance of high-skilled workers in terms of growing employment shares, group-level inequality and mean wages. Yet, a large part of inequality changes remains unexplained by observable factors. Chapter 2: The Effect of Foreign Acquisitions on Wages: Evidence from Hungarian Firm and Linked Employer-Employee Data (joint with John Earle and Álmos Telegdy)  This paper estimates the effects of foreign acquisitions on average and worker-specific wages in previously domestically owned firms in Hungary. The analysis is carried out both at the firm level using universal data for all Hungarian corporations and at the worker level using linked employer-employee data from a very large survey. The panel is much longer (23 years) than in previous studies and the data contain a large number of foreign acquisitions with information both before and after the change in ownership. Our empirical methods include matching on multiple years of pre-acquisition data and fixed effects for firms, detailed worker groups, and individuals (where workers can be linked inside firms). We also exploit reversals in ownership status: acquisition followed later by divestment. While point estimates are sensitive to specification, we find in all cases positive effects of FDI on average wages, and even on wages of all worker types. The only significantly higher foreign premium is associated with university education. We consider possible explanations for the findings, including productivity and rent-sharing, as well as selection and measurement. The evidence suggests that the foreign premium is strongly associated with a similar differential in productivity.  Chapter 3: Foreign Ownership and the Distribution of Wages in Hungary, 1992-2000: An Unconditional Quantile Decomposition Approach  With the help of a rich linked dataset on both firms and workers of the Hungarian corporate sector, this paper analyzes how changes in foreign direct investment contributed to changes in the unconditional wage distribution at different quantiles between 1992 and 2000. After transition, Hungary experienced an extraordinary amount of continuous FDI inflow during the nineties, while earnings inequality increased by close to seventy percent in just ten years, compared to its 1989 level. The role of FDI in inequality changes is partialed out by a detailed decomposition of log wage changes based on a recently developed method by Firpo et al. (2009) that extends the standard Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to unconditional quantiles of the distribution. I find that at every point in time, the share of employees of foreign-owned firms has a positive and significant wage level effect at every unconditional quantile, and these effects are inequality enhancing for men while they have an ambiguous effect on the unconditional dispersion for women. FDI contributed strongly to wage changes at every part of the distribution through an increased foreign employment share in the economy, but not through changes in the returns to being employed by foreign-owned firms. However, it played only a moderate role in the growth of inequality.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2796k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The first chapter examines how consumers choose eco-labeled products. It argues that eco-labels transform ordinary products into impure public goods: next to the usual product characteristics they offer consumers the possibility to contribute to reduced environmental pollution. As such, eco-labeled products are policy experiments in the private provision of public goods. Accordingly, when estimating the effect of an eco-label the consumer choice model has to incorporate various explanations for the private provision of public goods: pure altruism, warm glow and conditional cooperation. It is shown that conditional cooperation implies a demand system with interdependent preferences that transforms the usual discrete choice model into a discrete game. This modified demand system is identified based on the assumption of no conspicuous consumption. The model is estimated for the German eco-label the ""Blauer Engel"" using a household panel sample of toilet paper purchases. The results show that conditional cooperation is important in explaining consumer choices, although the effect of the Blauer Engel label is close to zero on average. The second chapter contributes to the disaggregated evidence about asymmetric price transmission. It studies how station-level retail prices respond to wholesale price changes in the Hungarian gasoline market. The estimates show that although retail price changes are almost symmetric on average, there is a subset of stations that follow an asymmetric pricing strategy. Having a closer look at station characteristics reveals that asymmetric pricing is a brand property and that these brands have small market share (below 10%) and are not vertically integrated. Other observables, like the number or the types of competitors do not explain the asymmetric retail price response. These results imply that in the same local market there are firms that price symmetrically and firms that price asymmetrically. This finding does not support collusion and search based explanations of asymmetric price transmission, because these are based on market level interactions among firms and consumers. Instead, it points towards the role of adjustment costs as an explanation for asymmetric retail price responses. Moreover, the result that the number and the types of competitors does not explain asymmetric pricing lends additional support to the claim that pricing asymmetry does not necessarily imply collusive behavior. The third chapter applies difference-in-differences methods to identify the price effects of simultaneous mergers in the Hungarian retail gasoline market and to separate the different effects on the prices of the buyer and seller firms and on the prices of their respective competitors. The difference-in-differences approach exploits variation in the presence of merging firms across local markets to form different treatment-control group pairs in order to estimate separate effects for each type of firms affected by the mergers. This ex-post evaluation shows that both mergers resulted in a significant and positive but economically negligible price effect. Separating the simultaneous merger effects also reveals that the first merger affected only the prices of buyer firm\'s stations, the second had an effect on the prices of seller\'s stations and of its competitors. These results are not sensitive to the assumed dates when the mergers effectively change the firms\' pricing policy.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1043k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Among the variety of areas in which the LEED can potentially be utilized, my thesis examines earning regressions and production functions supplemented with information on both the employers and the employees. Wage regressions based on LEED may control for – besides the individual level variables, such as age, gender, education, occupation – various firm-level variables. Production functions including traditionally only firm level variables, such as the capital and the labor input, may be augmented with the worker composition of the firm offering the opportunity to study e.g. the relative productivity of various employee groups. The first chapter of the thesis utilizes the rich firm-level and employee information of the LEED to investigate the wage differential associated with the conclusion of firm-level collective contracts. The historical roots of the Hungarian trade unions are in a sharp contrast with the origins of the industrial relations system in Western European or Anglo-Saxon countries. After the regime change, trade unions in the transitional countries had to reorganize themselves, find their new roles in the fundamentally changed economic environment, and cope with their social inheritance. The outcome was a decentralized structure, where the firm-level trade unions are the most important channel of collective negotiations. The estimation results mostly reflect this fragmented industrial relations system, and imply that the wage advantage associated with firm-level agreements is tiny. The 26 percent raw wage gap estimated on individual-level data decreases to 6 percent after controlling for individual and firm-level characteristics, and to 2 percent when including time invariant firm-level unobservables. On the other hand, firm-level regressions using an accounting measure, the total wage bill of the firm as the dependent variable, suggest a surprisingly high wage gap of 8 percent in the final specification. Chapter 2 and 3 pursue a different path, and – building on the rich employee and employer information of the LEED – investigate production functions in the way pioneered by Hellerstein and Neumark (1999). In Chapter 2 (joint with Anna Lovász) we examine the long-term adjustment process following the sudden devaluation of certain labor market skills due to the technological and organizational changes brought about by the regime change. Our hypothesizes are based on the model of skill obsolescence and imply that (a) the devaluation of skills should affect highly educated older workers more severely (b) the disadvantage should disappear over time as newer cohorts acquire more suitable human capital, and (c) the timing should differ among firm ownership types, reflecting the inflow of modern technologies and practices. The results suggest that - in line with the model - the within firm productivity differential between older and younger workers following the transition was largest among the highly skilled (-0.13 in 1996-2000). The fall in relative productivity followed the inflow of modern capital: the gap was largest in 1992-1995 in foreign-owned firms (-0.6), while it appeared later in domestic firms (-0.18 in 1996-2000) before disappearing by 2006. Chapter 3, also based on the worker composition augmented production function methodology, aims to give a more detailed picture of the relationship between age and productivity. Ageing is a particularly relevant research question in Hungary, where both the demographic trends and the low employment rate of the older worker groups make it difficult to cope with the increasing economic burdens of an ageing society. The results on the pooled sample (covering the years 1992-2008) are suggestive that older workers are less productive. Estimates in the within dimension document that productivity drops significantly at the ages of 35, 45, and 55. However, splitting the panel into two samples (before and after 2000) reveals that the productivity disadvantage of older employees disappears in the second period, and methods taking care of both the unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity issues indicate an essentially flat age – productivity profile in that period. Therefore, the Hungarian results covering the most recent years do not confirm the usual skepticism over the negative impact of the ageing population on firms’ productivity.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3822k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

These studies measure the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) to changes in the marginal tax rate and find a significant positive effect. The ETI is especially important when governments reduce the tax rates substantially in order to boost their economic and tax revenues. Although there are signs that some countries do manage to improve on both fronts, it is hard to differentiate the behavioural response to tax changes from the effect of increased tax enforcement. This thesis addresses this gap by analysing the elasticity of taxable income both of employees and self-employed and by estimating the distribution of income underreporting throughout the total taxpayer population. The first chapter estimates the elasticity of taxable income in Hungary. Results suggest a relatively small but highly significant tax price elasticity of about 0.06 for the population earning above the minimum wage (around 70% of all taxpayers). This number increases to around 0.3 when we focus on the upper 20% of the income distribution, with some income groups exhibiting even higher elasticities (0.45). In the second chapter of this thesis, I analyse the elasticity of reported income to tax rates of the self-employed. The ETI captures several margins of adjustment. Most importantly, labour supply changes after tax reforms but taxpayers also adjust their income underreporting behaviour. Hungary introduced a new type of tax for small enterprises with a substantially lower tax rate. I use this tax reform to analyse the elasticity of the self-employed. The overall ETI of the self-employed is about twice as large as for the total employee population (12%). The third chapter of this thesis estimates the distributional implications of income tax evasion in Hungary. Tax evasion has serious implications for the income distribution, as it alters the disposable income of households through the altered payment of tax. In this exercise, gross incomes declared in the administrative tax returns are compared with incomes stated in a nationally representative household budget survey. Estimates show that the average rate of underreporting is 8-18%, but this conceals a big difference between the self-employed (who hide a greater part of their income) and employees. These rates are used in a tax–benefit microsimulation model to calculate the fiscal and distributional implications of underreporting. Tax evasion reduces households’ personal income tax payment by about 8–20%. Poverty and inequality seem significantly higher if calculations are based on true income rather than its reported figure. Finally, tax evasion greatly reduces the progressivity of the tax system.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (3816k)'}"

Therefore it is important to improve our understanding of the economic decisions made by the aging population. In this thesis I consider two economic decisions: the consumption decisions related to changing life expectancy, and decisions on health care utilization. I analyze how people aged 50 and above adjust their consumption expenditures if their subjective longevity changes, how their health care utilization depends on the coverage with voluntary private health insurance, and I also analyze the utilization of outpatient health care services related to the health care institutions. The thesis consists of three chapters. All chapters are based on empirical work. In the empirical analysis I use the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) database. The SHARE is a cross-national panel database covering individuals aged 50 and above. The survey focuses on the socioeconomic and health status of the respondents. In this thesis I use the first two waves of the survey. In the first chapter I estimate the effect of changes in subjective mortality hazard on consumption expenditures using the first two waves of the SHARE data. I measure mortality expectations with survey responses to a question on survival probability. To create plausibly exogenous variation in mortality hazard, I use the death of a sibling as an instrument. I find that a four-year decrease in the expected remaining lifetime at age 60 increases consumption by 7-9 percent in the subpopulation of individuals with positive financial wealth, who are likely not liquidity constrained. My results show that survey responses contain economically relevant information about longevity expectations, and confirm the predictions of life-cycle theories about the effect of these expectations on intertemporal choice. In the second chapter I investigate if voluntary private health insurance coverage influences health care utilization in countries where the coverage ratio with public health insurance is high. I estimate this effect using the first wave of SHARE. Handling the potential endogeneity of voluntary insurance coverage and the large fraction of zero observations in the utilization models influences the empirical results. I show that the effect of private health insurance coverage on inpatient and outpatient care utilization is not trivial even in countries with generous public health funding. The main finding of this chapter is that voluntary private health insurance coverage increases dental care utilization, but decreases the visits to general practitioners. Private insurance is estimated to have little and insignificant influence on the utilization of inpatient care and outpatient specialist care. The magnitude of the effect of voluntary private health insurance on health care utilization varies with the characteristics of the health care systems. While in the first two chapters my aim is to estimate causal effects with an emphasis on the econometric methodology, the third chapter is more policy oriented. I analyze the relationship between health care institutions and the utilization of outpatient services by individuals aged 50 and above. I use cross-sectional data from the second wave of SHARE. The focus of this chapter is on the out-of-pocket costs of health care utilization, the gatekeeper role of general practitioners, and how these institutional settings are related to public and private care utilization. The results indicate that public financing has positive but moderate association with outpatient care utilization among the analyzed population. Copayments are related negatively to the probability of visiting a general practitioner among those in good health condition. I estimate the demand for private specialist care services to be higher in countries where there are copayments required for public specialist care, and where the general practitioners have gatekeeper role. These estimated effects on private specialist care utilization are relatively large, and are driven by the wealthier individuals. In sum, the findings of this thesis indicate that the elderly people in Europe adjust their consumption expenditures if subjective longevity changes, and that their health care utilization is influenced in a non-trivial way by private health insurance coverage. Variations in the health care financing settings and the gatekeeper role of general practitioners are also related to the health care utilization of the people aged 50 and above, and these relations are heterogenous across the analyzed population.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (808k)'}"

Chapter 1 demonstrates that while previous research shows that the rich should save more and should have lower debt burden, in the case of credit cards the relationship is empirically non-monotonic: credit card borrowing is the highest in the case of households with medium permanent income. The chapter then reviews the related literature and argues that the neoclassical explanations (e.g., liquidity constraints or precautionary savings) account for about half of the peak in the credit card debt-to-income ratio of the middle-class, so these should be extended with behavioral explanations (e.g., with “animal spirits” models of temptation and self control or with investment mistakes) to fully understand the empirical fact. Chapter 2 contributes to the emerging literature of the transactional use of credit cards. First, a simple neoclassical model of convenience use is presented in which households use credit card if the marginal benefit from the usage is higher than the marginal cost. Afterwards, the model is extended to incorporate uncertainty and present biased preferences. The second part of this chapter presents an empirical analysis that supports the previous transactional use model. While some findings are fully in line with the neoclassical version of the model, several other empirical examples point towards potential biases and mistakes in the transactional use decision. Contributing to the literature of advertising, Chapter 3 uses a unique data set of an anonymous European bank to analyze the impact of personal loan advertising on loan demand. The chapter reports that television commercials have higher impact on loan applications than internet or newspaper advertising. Furthermore, certain customer segments, namely rich or young individuals react to TV advertising more than poorer or older individuals, respectively. Motivated by these empirical facts, the chapter develops a life cycle consumption model with three potential channels through which advertising alters borrowing. First, advertising may provide information about the existence of the brand. Second, commercials may provide information about the interest rates. Finally, advertising may act as a taste shifter. The empirical facts are in line with the latter persuasive view of advertising, and among other plausible explanations, the facts point towards the importance of internal self-control mechanisms.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (864k)'}"

The approach here is a stochastic extension of the cash-in-advance economy with a banking sector that allows for the production of credit as an alternative to cash. The stochastic extension, and in particular the productivity shocks of the banking sector allows a convenient setup for analyzing credit and banking history, where for instance, positive credit shocks could be consistent with financial deregulatory periods, and negative shocks consistent with credit crises. This work consists of six chapters. The first chapter sets up the methodological framework used in the subsequent chapters for the analysis. Chapter 2, ""A comparison of exchange economies within a monetary business cycle"" compares the performance of the cash-only, shopping time and credit production models in explaining the puzzles of the monetary business cycle theory. Chapter 3, ""Credit shocks in the financial deregulatory era: Not the usual suspects"" constructs goods productivity, money and credit productivity shocks. Credit shocks are interpreted in terms of changes in banking legislation during the US financial deregulation era, being also a candidate that matters in determining GDP fluctuations. Chapter 4, ""Money Velocity in an Endogenous Growth Business Cycle with Credit Shocks"" extends the credit model to an endogenous growth framework. Money and credit shocks explain much of the velocity variation Chapter 5, ""Volatility Cycles of Output and Inflation, 1919-2004: A Money and Banking Approach to a Puzzle"", explains the close comovement of volatilities of GDP growth and inflation over 1919-2004 period using money and credit shocks that have different effects in different subperiods. The post-1983 moderation also coincided with an ahistorical divergence in the money aggregate growth and velocity volatilities away from the downward trending GDP and inflation volatilities. The volatility divergence is explained by the upswing in the credit volatility that kept money supply variability from translating into inflation and GDP volatility.

The third chapter separates the effect of financial incentives from the availability of pension and shows that despite being significant, the former is weaker than the latter.

After reviewing the theory of multinationals, I turn to models of knowledge transfer, in particular to the relationship between knowledge transfer and competition, and to its empirical relevance. In Chapter 2 I estimate horizontal and vertical spillover effects and deal with the spatial dimension, that is, whether physical distance matters. The results show that distance is important in the case of horizontal spillovers, suggesting that knowledge transfer is effective only on smaller distances. In Chapter 3 I turn to the question, whether the technology chosen by multinationals affects the productivity of domestic firms. This chapter provides evidence that spillovers from more labour intensive industries and firms are less positive. Chapter 4 asks if foreign entry leads to spillovers in terms of markups besides productivity. The regressions results show that multinational entry leads to change in the markups of domestic firms.

Preceding the regime switch, the exchange rate is derived as a function of the following factors: fundamental, market expectations for both the Euro locking rate, and date. Similarly, the exchange rate volatility is a function of the covariances of these factors. The model is applied to examine how the prospect of locking influences the exchange rate volatility in three EMU candidate countries. The stabilizing effect, estimated from currency option prices, is found to be substantial despite of the highly uncertain locking date and rate.  Title of Chapter 2: Filtering the Market Expectation for the Euro Locking Rate in the Extended Asset-Pricing Exchange Rate Model  Abstract: This paper investigates the market expectation for the Euro locking rate in a regime switching model. This regime switch is the locking of the exchange rates of the EMU candidate countries at the final conversion rate. First, the process of the exchange rate is derived in the extended asset-pricing exchange rate model as a function of the processes of three factors, the latent exchange rate and the market expectation for the Euro locking rate and date. Then, the model is applied to analyze the exchange rates of the Czech Koruna, the Hungarian Forint, and the Polish Z loty versus the Euro in the period between January 4, 2005, and March 6, 2007. The latent exchange rate, the expected locking rate and date are filtered from the historical exchange rate, interest rate and currency option data. The expected locking rate is found to be an important component of the exchange rate.  Title of Chapter 3: Target Zone Realignments and Exchange Rate Behavior in an Options-Based Model  Abstract: This paper develops an options-based model of target zone arrangements. The exchange rate in a target zone system is modeled as a fundamental term adjusted by the price of two options. The paper provides an accurate description of the options, which can capture the joint effect of the edges of the band. The model can be applied for a wide range of processes of the fundamental. The model is used to decompose exchange rate changes after band realignment into the direct effect of realignment, changing expectations and changing uncertainty.

Policies and legislation lack the inclusion of these Global Goals. The policy-making of the EU is highly complex system in which advocacy groups are important catalysers of change and hence play a key role in the implementation of the SDGs. Therefore, the research looked at how European advocacy groups engage in the promotion of the SDGs through policy network-, and framing analysis. The research found that advocacy groups have been engaging in different cross-sectoral collaborations to join the debate on the SDGs. The European Commission’s Multi Stakeholder Platform (MSP) on the Implementation of the SDGs and the SDG Watch Europe were the two key cross-sectoral collaborations that the researched focused on. The MSP is a policy network within which advocacy groups engage in framing activities. The research identified two frames that revealed how different organisations approach the Global Goals. Two key trends of SDG framing are identified in this thesis; one that promotes systemic change through understanding the agenda as a guiding principle, and another one that neglects the systemic nature of the goals and engages them only as a secondary issue. The battle of these frames is brought to the fore by evaluating one of the campaigns of the SDG Watch Europe. Even though systemic framing is making its way to the EU decision-makers there is a long way ahead before sustainability becomes a guiding principle.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Increasing traffic volumes not only cause time and speed losses, they cause a wide range of motor vehicle externalities. Namely, dangerous air pollution which affects health of the population, emission of greenhouses gasses, soil and water contamination, noise pollution, ecosystem fragmentation. A considerable research has been conducted on the mechanism of road pricing, aimed to regulate demand on urban road space. This study firstly aims to understand why – despite its evident economic and environmental benefits – this mechanism has mostly developed in theory. This will be complemented with the analysis of the other possible mechanism to tackle congestion. Next, a case study research of the application of this mechanism in the EU will be conducted. It is suggested that Budapest could became the next European capital to implement a road pricing mechanism. Prerequisites required for this are strong political will and effective stakeholder collaboration. There are valuable lessons from London and Stockholm cases to take into consideration when developing the Budapest scheme. However, it is also argued that prior the implementation, a comprehensive traffic monitoring system should be established. Subsequently, this will develop evidence and feasibility of the scheme. It appears that public acceptance raises when discourse concentrates around the health and environmental benefits, rather than technical infrastructure improvements. This paper analyses options for road charging schemes and suggests implementation of the dynamic elements to the model. This approach hasn’t yet been implemented in any urban area, but it can overcome drawbacks of the fixed pricing schemes.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Trust in politicians, experts and institutions has been declining for decades as citizens feel unable to control the decisions that affect their daily lives; consequently, echo-chambers, particularisation and polarisation prevail. The desire for change is palpable, yet democracy seems ill-equipped to cope with today’s challenges. Climate change is one such incidence. Although citizens seek an augmented role for science, scepticism and uncertainty combined with scientists’ distance from decisions inhibit their impact, while myopia, vested-interests and the costs of change preclude political action.  Prominent scholars have propagated civic science and deliberative democracy as solutions to these crises. Thus, Ireland – which serves as a microcosm of these issues with low trust and environmental inaction – established the Irish Citizens’ Assembly (ICA) to deliberate upon climate matters. Hence, this thesis critically evaluates the legitimacy of the ICA in light of participants’ perspectives.  Seventeen semi-structured interviews - with ICA members and other key actors - triangulated with secondary sources form the basis of this research. The findings illustrated the importance of transparency - particularly before and after the process - while recruitment anomalies and agenda-setting were evident. Self/group versus majority interest also emerged as a prevalent theme particularly relating to rural constituents’ concerns. Furthermore, the priority of outcomes and the consequent need to strengthen the link between input and output processes became apparent. Nevertheless, the conclusions suggest that the ICA resulted in not only better decisions, but also a ‘better’ - more engaged, informed and trusting – citizenry.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This research aims to explore the generation options, quantify the amount of the Off-grid electricity in Juba and establish how such amount can be connected to the grid system by conducting a survey study involving 44 companies, 2 government institutions and 2 solar energy retailers. The study found that the current Off-grid installed generation capacity in Juba is higher than On-grid with a total of 28.93 MW from 142 generators. 98% of this amount is diesel-fired electricity and only 2% is from solar. However, to keep these generators running, the companies spend US$ 533,204 monthly to procure 589,760 litres of diesel which emit 1553.8 tCO2.

Energy transition in Denmark presents one of the most noteworthy and well-known examples of effective change from usage of imported fossils to highly growing share of different forms of renewable energy (Mey and Diesendorf 2017). According to International Energy Agency data, Denmark presents one of the world leaders in the renewable energy consumption and aims to be a low carbon society independent of fossil fuels by 2050, and dependent on renewables for more than a half of total energy consumption by 2030. Yet, in Serbia, exploitation of RES for energy production is far under their potentials (Golusin et al, 2010). Having in mind that Serbia has adopted Kyoto protocol and became a part of Energy Community, development of renewable energy sector has become obligatory activity (Golusin et al, 2010). Substantial renewable energy resources that Serbia obtains (Golusin et al, 2010) are making this analysis easily justifiable for identification of challenges and opportunities for implementing the Danish model in Serbian energy sector which faces many barriers to its growth. Focusing on national energy transitions to data collected via a literature review and interviews conducted in Serbia, this thesis is striving to identify important solutions in the field of renewable energy from Danish experience and give specific proposal and suggestions for further development of Serbia in this field.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Populations have experienced declines in recent years, and although often attributed to agricultural intensification, there are several other influencing factors. The invasive European hare lepus Europaeus has successfully naturalized in many countries across the Eurasian continent, including a small but established population in Northern Ireland. Changing climatic conditions are predicted to cause a contraction in the bioclimatic range of the endemic, and an expansion in favor of the invasive. Furthermore, existing bioclimatic models fail to account for the loss of available habitat due to anthropogenic disturbance, namely urban fabric and increasing human population densities. The study aims to conduct a combined assessment of these threats, conducting a habitat suitability analysis using ArcGIS 10.2.2 to determine available territory, as well as predicting likely future distribution based on changing climatic conditions using the maximum entropy species distribution modeling approach (MaxEnt).  Although current conditions are favorable, suitable territory was determined to be circa 20% less than when calculated using solely bioclimatic variables as in previous studies. However, combined with predicted future climatic conditions, and accounting for a possible competitive exclusion due to European hare colonization, available habitat for the endemic is reduced to a fraction of its current size.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

To determine this attitude, three main market players were examined, using structured and semi-structured interviews, personal communication and the review of Climate-KIC’s internal documents. As a preliminary expectation, the startups, the venture capital funds and the Climate-KIC cleantech incubator program were identified as the most significant market players. In contrast based on the findings the intergovernmental and governmental institutions are also dominant market players, they financially support the venture capital funds and the incubators as well. The main problem with the market is that it is difficult to express the positive environmental impact in financial terms, therefore it is not included in the company value during evaluation. As in every market cleantech investors are also looking for profitable solutions which are rare, risky and it takes a long time until the profit is realized in this field.

It is found in the literature that decentralized solutions such as renewable off-grid systems can be a viable and more efficient option for rural electrification. Recently, a smart solar off-grid system has been developed in Dharnai village in Bihar with the assistance of Greenpeace India. The aim of the thesis was to investigate and identify drivers and barriers to the growth of the solar off-grid system in Dharnai, fill the knowledge gap about the solar off-grid sector, and provide recommendations to improve the sector in the state. Data collected from interviews and focus group discussion in Dharnai was analyzed using Painuly’s (2001) framework. The findings suggested that significant drivers are unmet demands of consumers, policy ambitions, consumer’s capacity and willingness to pay, benefits of solar perceived by consumers, an indicator of development, and uncertainty about the grid connection. Furthermore, significant barriers to the growth of solar off-grid systems are policy loopholes, unmet demands of consumers, consumer’s affordability, and lack of financing options. The thesis recommends that the Bihar government should start awareness campaigns to improve consumer’s lack of awareness about the benefits of solar off-grid systems; make grid expansion predictable so that consumers have clarity about its timeline; take appropriate measures to improve financing and overall affordability of the consumers.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The rising population is one of the other important factors which directly proportionate with the quantity of discharge of wastewater. In the early 20th century, when environmental laws were slowly introduced, no laws existed to regulate the discharge of wastewater. However, with the economic development and the resulting negative impacts on the environment, laws on the environment were enforced and became important. The treatment of wastewater to achieve safe levels was difficult in older times. This is because the early technology allowed to treat one or two contaminants at a time and allowed other major contaminants to flow in the environment. Discharge of harmful and hazardous chemical and bacteriological contaminants present in the wastewater posed a big problem. Some of the effects of releasing the wastewater in the water bodies or rivers are degradation of the quality of water, decline in the population of aquatic plants and animals, eutrophication or algal bloom and waterborne diseases impacting the health of people. This thesis focuses on the newly developed technology called Cyclator (which is based on the sequencing batch reactor) to treat the wastewater efficiently and safely disposing of the wastewater in the environment. The samples were collected from the treated effluent of Cyclator and compared with the discharge standards to check the compliance. The results showed all the parameters were under the compliance of discharge standards and Cyclator is efficient in treating the wastewater.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

To achieve this research aim, statistical methods were utilized to identify the trends and change points in hydroclimatic variables, and to detect the correlation between hydrological and climatic indices. Based on the results of the trend analysis, certain patterns both in terms of streamflow and climatic indices were captured. While in Georgia streamflow of Kura River experienced an increasing trend, especially during cold months, a serious decrease was detected in Azerbaijan for most months. Furthermore, the analysis of climatic indices also signals certain patterns aligning with climate change characteristics such as increase in precipitation in cold months as well as increase in temperature generally. Correlation analysis further carried out also highlighted the impacts of these changes since the early snowmelts caused by the increasing temperature and precipitation, Kura River experienced an increase in streamflow for the cold months, while for the dry months certain decrease is the case due to the increase in temperature of the region.

Because of these benefits, existence of well- developed energy data management in a country is very important. Lack of data and data collection mechanisms hamper multifaceted research and planning activities which depend on it. In a rapidly growing country like India, the scarcity and inaccessibility of useful energy data brings more harm and has been criticized by scholars as a bottleneck in the system. Studies, particularly qualitative, on this topic are very limited. Studies around energy data are predominantly about the economics and performance of schemes and are built upon technical parameters. The research aims to address the knowledge gap by investigating the challenges to the existing energy data management system in India. Through reviewing literature and semi- structured interviews with experts in the field, the research points to four dominant themes. These are: the existing collection mechanism itself, present data gaps, socio-political motives of the government and the lack of research on energy data management. The highly decentralized system creates scattered data, making no single agency responsible for coordinating the overall management. One recommendation is for the future research to take these factors, as well as other aspects, when studying energy data management in India. Such a qualitative approach is valuable because it pulls the attention to ‘missing data’, which is often not as neutral in its effects as it seems.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

However, no in-depth research has been conducted into the way ENGO’s in Russia are utilizing social media to put the environment on the mainstream agenda and foster concrete action towards solving the ecological issues facing the country. This research seeks to address this gap because Russia is the world’s largest country by territory and one of the largest in terms of population. It is therefore essential to understand whether ENGO’s and environmental advocacy groups in Russia are utilizing social media like their western counterparts to tackle the country’s most pressing environmental problems and if yes, how and with what perceived success. In-depth interviews with communications experts from several Moscow-based ENGO’s suggest that social media channels are allowing Russian ENGO’s to bypass traditional media and offering a cost-effective way to reach and engage the Russian public, though their choice of social networking sites is rather different to those used in the West.

Limited evidence in the existing literature suggests that the Overview Effect – the cognitive shift in awareness experienced by astronauts as a result of seeing Earth from outer space – may contain much greater ecological dimensions than has been previously implied. Based on 14 first-hand interviews with astronauts, this study utilizes interpretive phenomenological analysis to qualitatively demonstrate that the Overview Effect has a distinct ecological significance that results in positive changes to astronauts’ environmental attitudes and behaviours. Besides this change, the results qualitatively map the breadth and depth of astronauts’ present environmental attitudes and behaviours, which has also not been done prior to this study. The outer space perspective of Earth, which includes negative perceptual views of anthropogenic ecological destruction on the surface of the planet, is shown to add a new and additional element to environmentalism, and as such discourse analysis is used to demonstrate how the ecological impulse concept is useful for advancing theoretical formulations of how spaceflight affects environmental attitudes. Furthermore, an expanded definition of the astroenvironmentalism concept is proposed to encapsulate this distinct form of environmentalism, to facilitate more straightforward discussions on the topic, and to make this phenomenon and form of environmentalism more relevant and accessible to a wider audience.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

These grassroot networks started to challenge the ruling practice of the industrialized agriculture and they also started to shape the discourse around seed challenging its dominantly understood objectified commodity characteristics. However, the meanings associated with seed in relation to farmer seed networks have only begun to be researched. One of the first farmer seed networks in Hungary, Magház, only emerged after 2013. Their appearance was extremely significant in the country considering that their innovative activity creates the potential to spread the knowledge on agrobiodiversity to broader audiences and to challenge the dominant understandings of industrialized agriculture. Using qualitative methods, this thesis identifies a variety of meanings associated with seed in Hungary, showing that the concepts forming around seed are very rich. It emphasizes that the perspectives of a wide range of actors should also be taken into account, not only the discourse of the formal seed system. The thesis also analyses the types of social innovation achieved by Magház farmer seed network and six local communities dedicated to agrobiodiversity conservation, particularly in relation to dominant institutes. The research expands the current studies on Magház and local communities with more specific knowledge by identifying four barriers that reinforce the status of dominant structures and three opportunities that may empower the network and may help them to further achieve innovative changes that shape discourses around agrobiodiversity in Hungary.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

More than a million refugees have settled in the Teknaf region of Bangladesh, in Kutupalong Refugee Camp, an overcrowded makeshift settlement that has since become of the world’s largest refugee camps. The camp is situated in an area that used to be previously forested, leading to deforestation, which has made the camp’s inhabitants vulnerable to environmental hazards. Some of the problems facing them include lack of healthcare, nutrition, sanitation, and risk of landslides and flooding during the monsoon. This study quantified the rate of deforestation using remotely-sensed imagery, and found that since the start of the crisis, Non-Forest area has seen a gain of 34 square kilometers, and Forest area has lost 15 square kilometers Out of 79 square kilometers of the study area, a total of 47 square kilometers are denuded in 2019.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a global warming potential (GWP) 25-28 times that of carbon dioxide.

The IPCC includes a set of models for estimating landfill methane emissions in its Guidelines for compiling bottom-up (B-U) national inventories. Top-down (T-D) studies using atmospheric-based measurements generate estimates independent of bottom-up (B-U) inventory estimates. This study includes analysis of more than 50 T-D studies conducted in both the United States (US) and European Union (EU) to determine context-dependency of the accuracy of inventory landfill emissions estimates. These findings are leveraged by information supplied through a comprehensive literature review of research regarding landfill emissions quantification, in order to draft meta-inferences explaining discrepancies observed between estimates. Both strands of knowledge inform application of a model framework for inferring T-D emissions estimates in three different scenarios. Results indicate that landfill emissions are more likely underestimated in the US than in the EU. This is potentially the result of US operators wrongly accounting for efficiency of landfill gas (LFG) recovery equipment in models for estimating emissions. As well, a lack of transparency in terms of reporting protocols applied may contribute to the lack of overall representativeness of accepted figures. Areas for further research include use of T-D and other measurement-based methods in landfill emissions inventory compilation, validation of EU landfill emissions estimates, and evaluation of the model framework applied here.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The research focuses on how this transition can be done in a just manner in coal regions, where local people are witnessing the end of an industry that ensured their livelihoods and cultural identity for generations. Using the energy justice framework, this research consists in an analysis of the case of Jiu Valley, an emblematic coal region in south-western Romania. In here, the coal industry is on the verge of a complete shutdown, while the locals are being left behind without employment alternatives. A professional reconversion program launched in 2019 brings new hope in the region.

Based on qualitative research, the dissertation’s argument is that while the program has a high potential in the area by addressing the pressing issue of unemployment in Jiu Valley, so far, the program fails to positively impact the community. Two of the main reasons identified for this failure are, on the one hand, national political instability and lack of funds, and, on the other hand, a lack of recognition and procedural justice during the process of selecting, interviewing, training and employing the candidates from Jiu Valley. Out of tens of miners and formers miners who applied for the program, only one person was selected, trained and employed in the wind power industry.

Worldwide, nations are pursuing different energy transition pathways but with the common agenda of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing or sustaining their economies. Africa’s energy transition studies are unique in that they involve more of expansion and modernization of their RE systems rather than shifting from heavy fossil fuels as exemplified by Kenya; one of the continental leaders in RE transitions. The current energy transition is exposing energy poverty as a considerable challenge to Kenya’s energy demands and future socio-economic development goals. Despite the uniqueness demonstrated in Kenya and Africa as a whole in energy transition, research on the drivers and hindrances towards their transition pathways are comparatively scarce. Studies on the interconnection between energy poverty and energy transition are also limited. Hence, this research sheds light on Kenya’s energy transition and energy poverty nexus by using qualitative interviews and literature review. The results of this research demonstrate that Kenya’s RE systems are highly associated with techno-economic, socio-technical and political drivers and the challenges facing the transition are related to gradual rate of change experienced in institutional, financial, policy and social frameworks. Additionally, the energy poverty nexus to energy transition indicate that the availability of RE has increased significantly, while accessibility, affordability and reliability are still lagging. This research concludes by recommending that energy poverty should not be sidelined in the transition process and calls for the holistic integration of all RE technologies and sectors if the ambitious transition targets are to be attained.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Latour and Haraway’s work on relationality provides insight into the LFV. Latour’s actor-network theory increases the range of entities and objects that participate in networks and gives these actors greater agency. The concept of the Anthropocene means that relations between the human and the more-than-human have become central forces, and provides historical, political and economic background to the current ecological crisis. Acceptance of the Anthropocene and Gaia means that we exist in a limited critical zone. Latour and Haraway argue against universalizing ethical systems. Latour advocates ethical sensitization and Haraway argues for situated knowledge and attention to entanglement and injustice.

Focusing on these emerging challenges, scholars have not systematically engaged in a retrospective analysis of previous industrial decline that can contain valuable lessons for the ongoing transition. The thesis systematically reviews the post-transitional literature based on three main categories according to intervention levels (regions and communities, companies, and individuals) and associated 11 sub-categories highlighting specific policy instruments to mitigate consequences for the affected groups. It conducts a systematic analysis of the employment effects of historical coal transition to deduce lessons from post-transitional literature to inform future research and policy in sustainability transition. The findings highlight that policymakers should focus on developing functioning institutions (i.e., higher education institutions, universities, research hubs) rather than public infrastructure to boost regional attractiveness for investors and nudge for job creation in the affected regions. Concerning companies, the findings emphasize the importance of government in sharing the liabilities with companies to ensure compliance with distributional justice, through reducing pension premiums and healthcare liabilities, and mine remediation and restoration costs. Regarding individuals, the findings suggest that governments should conduct an accurate statistical analysis of workersâ€™ age groups before closures, to identify the proportion of workers who might seek early retirement benefits and those who can be retrained for reemployment.

Energy security concerns have long been dominating the EU-RF energy relationship due to this overdependence and vulnerability to external supply shocks. Simultaneously, the EU set ambitious decarbonisation goals with the aim of a low-carbon economy. Considering that decarbonisation has the potential to fundamentally transform established energy relationships, analysing this aspect is especially important in the EU-RF relationship due to their mutual dependence. Consequently, the aim of this thesis was to examine the energy security and decarbonisation discourses in the EU-RF energy relationship from the EU’s perspective, considering this duality of energy policy objectives of the EU. As Jean-Claude Juncker was appointed President of the European Commission shortly after the Crimean crisis, and the Paris Agreement was negotiated during his presidency, this period is ideal to synthesise the EU’s views. My approach to this study was based on discourse analysis, using various sources published by the European Commission and individual Commissioners. My analysis turned out to be in line with previous research arguing that energy security plays the leading role, and the negative perception of the RF strengthened further during this period. There was also strong emphasis on negative interdependence due to geographical and infrastructural circumstances. While there were initiatives for cooperation under the decarbonisation discourse, decarbonisation was perceived mostly as a tool by the EU to reduce vulnerability to Russian supply disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

City residents will become vulnerable to extreme weather events, especially heat waves that impose an additional threat to human health and well-being. Green spaces have a direct impact on microclimatic features of the urban environment, as the ambient temperature in parks is lower in comparison to areas with multi-story buildings. However, due to urbanization, there is a lack of free spaces for green infrastructure development, especially in city centers and new built-up subdivisions of the city. Thus, the research aims to study nature-based solutions (NBS) as an additional option to green spaces in urban areas and a response to negative effects of climate change. To obtain data, academic sources, policy documents and governmental web-sites as well as grey literature were examined and official requests on information were done. Through the content analysis, the status of nature-based solutions in Kyiv, Melbourne and Tianjin was explored with specific attention allocated to NBS for climate change adaptation, resilience and mitigation. Additionally, the main policy documents that ensure the development of green spaces and NBS in the cities of interest were studied. By using comparative analysis, the most effective examples of NBS for heat stress reduction and policy documents that support their development in Melbourne and Tianjin were applied to Kyiv case. The results acquired through this research showed that green roofs, walls and facades on buildings, indoor greening and community gardens, among others can be applicable in Kyiv.

At the same time, Israel – a country with a climate similar to that of Cape Town – was also experiencing severe drought. In contrast, Israel showed the exact opposite trend, achieving water security despite these adverse conditions. This paper therefore aims to understand why the water security outcomes for these two regions were so different, given the similar circumstances. The method used for conducting the research is a comparative analysis, examining the threats to water security that both regions face, and how water security is approached. Findings showed that there are several reasons for the differing outcomes. Cape Town faced several challenges that Israel did not, such as the Apartheid and severe poverty; however, it seems that the challenges Israel did face -- such as large immigration waves and settling the desert made Israel’s water sector more resilient overall. This was thanks to the development of management practices such as supply augmentation via large-scale seawater desalination, utilizing treated wastewater, developing efficient agriculture technologies. Cape Town’s water management practices are far less comprehensive and developed. Additional findings show that Israel has prepared for climate change better than CoCT, a practice that may have influenced preparedness for surviving the drought.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The World Bank supports energy efficiency measures in public buildings in Kazakhstan. However, the impact of these measures on the energy use of public sector savings has not been systematically analyzed. This thesis shows that the impact of energy efficiency measures highly varies from almost negligible to very significant. The impact of energy efficiency measures on energy savings is often low because prior to applying these measures, the buildings were under-heated, but after the retrofit, the users increase heating to comfortable levels. The impacts of energy efficiency measures depend primarily on the climate zone, how frequently the building is used, and what fuel is used for heating. Buildings in colder climates, more frequently used, and using coal and diesel for heating provide the highest economic payoffs to energy efficiency measures.

This recognition of ecosystem services as vital to achieve sustainable development goals and climate change adaptation ambitions has led to a call for a multifaceted approach. One such approach is ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) which has been defined by the CBD (2009) as ""the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change as part of an overall adaptation strategy”. EbA is a relatively new concept that has gained substantial support in recent years, due to claims that it offers ‘win-win’ outcomes and ‘low regrets’ solutions. This research aimed to understand whether the extra benefits (win-win outcomes) believed to be associated with EbA compared to sectoral approaches are realised. The study used EbA in the context of a specific place-based project in the small island developing state of Fiji. The major finding was that the concept of EbA may not achieve all the outcomes it claims to produce in practice.

Effective use of ecosystem service valuation knowledge with a cost-benefit analysis can create resilient social-ecological systems. There is an increasing number of valuations being conducted, yet only one third of the studies are thought to be used in some form to aid in decision-making. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the barriers preventing more prolific use of this knowledge in decision-making processes, and to create a framework which identifies strategies to increase the use of ecosystem service valuation data and results. The use of this knowledge is applied to tropical forest ecosystems in Kalimantan, Indonesia where forests are being logged and converted to palm plantations. A literature review, systematic review of ecosystem service case studies, questionnaires and interviews were conducted in order to assess the knowledge-practice gap in ecosystem service valuations in Kalimantan. Identified barriers to the use of valuation knowledge in practice include lack of trust in data, lack of knowledge on how to use the scientific information, lack of a platform to apply the scientific results, short-sightedness of development projects and corruption. To overcome these barriers recommendations that follow from this thesis include: NGOs can promote the use of valuation data and results to stakeholders and provide training for their use, governments can create norms and laws to enforce the use of the knowledge, research donors can promote the use of applicable knowledge in funding applications and academics can engage decision-making stakeholders through the process of conducting the valuation. Further results in the context of Kalimantan illustrate that the economic benefits of conserving tropical forest ecosystems outweigh the benefits of converting the land to palm plantations in the long-run. Literature supports the fact that conservation creates more resilient social-ecological systems, meaning these valuation results can be beneficial for making decisions that increase the well- being of the people of Kalimantan.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This thesis aims to understand the perceptions of Palestinian agricultural food companies, farmers, and consumers regarding olive oil, and the extent to which Palestinian Fairtrade olive oil companies integrate social and ecological considerations in their work. As such, four different Fairtrade discourses are identified: Community, Certification, Political, and Beyond, which describe how Palestinian companies perceive Fairtrade. The extent to which the companies incorporate such considerations are influenced by their own views and experiences in including agroecological and social practices in their work. As for Palestinian farmers and consumers, results show that a general understanding of what Fairtrade entails is prevalent among them. Farmers perceive Fairtrade in line with values shared with the Community and Certification Fairtrade, while consumers associate Fairtrade with solidarity with the Palestinian farmer. The Beyond Fairtrade discourse represents an ideal version in Fairtrade that incorporates both social and ecological considerations. This also associates Palestinian olive oil with a sense of solidarity as well as an environmental cause: encouraging farmers to adopt traditional sustainable agricultural practices, thereby combing social and ecological considerations within the same discourse.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

As the call for an urgent paradigm shift has been voiced, the EU has responded to this challenge by offering solutions that act as a subset of the SD framework. The aim of this research was therefore to contribute to the development of coherent policy measures aiming to enhance the sustainability of the garment sector. A discourse analysis enabled to investigate the current European environmental policy development, which has been strongly shaped by the Green Economy (GE) theory. The European Commission has utilised the GE theory because it promises a framework capable of reaching a transition towards an economic model that is in line with planetary boundaries. The resulting policy discourse has further laid the foundation for the Circular Economy (CE) and Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) sustainability strategies to arise and be chosen as suitable concepts to address the environmental challenges of the garment sector. An in-depth analysis of two recent European initiatives, namely the EU Garment Initiative and the European Clothing Action Plan, has further enabled an examination of the overlaps and potential reinforcement of the two concepts.  What has become clear is that the CE and SSCM concepts should not be competing for attention but rather mutually reinforce each other, as their principles and conceptual elements go hand in hand. The mutual reinforcement of both concepts can therefore offer a more nuanced and integrative approach to finding the right solutions to enhance the overall sustainability of the garment sector at the EU level.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Urban development attracts more population which creates congested cities with unsustainable land-use strategies. A balanced relation between the urban architecture and the natural environment is the key to sustainable city development (S. M. Sheweka and Mohamed 2012). In the quest of the exact solution, researchers developed the concept of green infrastructure (GI). One of the attractive features of the GI is its multifunctionality which provides benefits in several dimensions including the environmental, social, and economic (European Commission 2012). Among many GIs, green walls (GW) have gained the attention of the city planners and the stakeholders in recent years as a very attractive way of sustainable urban designing. Because of its vertical structure, GWs bring added advantage in congested city greening. Instead of being widely known and appreciated for its benefits, GWs development faces many challenges and remains slow in most of the European countries. This study aims to find out the challenges and potential opportunities for GW development. For a detailed analysis, this research investigates GW development in Geneva, Switzerland as a case study. This allows the research to do an extensive analysis of the GW development and plays as a trade-off game between an in-depth study in a city versus the wider study in the European scale. The findings highlighted the lack of targeted policy and limited knowledge among the citizens as the major challenge and propose policy reforms focusing on GW development.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This thesis investigates the impact of EU membership on energy investments in the Balkan region, using Bulgaria and Serbia as case studies. Energy investments are dependent on the investment climate and the investor type. By identifying the key factors in the literature that influence these two variables, this thesis provides an in-depth overview of the socio-economic context, the legislative frameworks in place, and the contemporary energy profile in a comparative format. Supplemented with insights from regional experts, this thesis compares an EU member state (Bulgaria) with a non-EU member state (Serbia) while factoring the influence of characteristics, such as a historical centrally planned economy, coal-fueled electricity production, a level of perceived corruption and a techno-economic potential for renewables. Nonetheless, the findings show distinctive features that consequentially help explain the difference in the energy investment landscape. While significant legislative and investment involvement from the EU is not without its faults and contradictions, this thesis concludes that EU membership has previously, and may further provide the financial mechanisms and policy frameworks necessary to enable a considerable growth in renewables deployment in the Balkan region.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Concurrently, the financial sector plays a powerful role in sustainable infrastructure development but remains disconnected from discourse in socio-ecological resilience.

Stakeholders conceptualised uncertainty as risk, ambiguity and ignorance and multifunctionality as politically-motivated shared benefits. Numerous efforts to adopt emerging decision methods that consider these terms were in use but required compromises to accommodate the persistent, conventional decision paradigm, though a range of future opportunities were identified. Bridging these findings to finance revealed opportunities to consider a more comprehensive scope of risk, leverage risk mitigation measures, diffuse risks and benefits over space, time and to diverse actor groups, and to clarify roles to achieve multiple objectives for resilience.

Iran provides the largest amount of fossil fuels consumption subsidies in the world, but it implemented the Targeted Subsidies Act to reform its subsidies and increase energy carriers’ end-user prices. This thesis investigated GHG emissions reduction effects and potentials of fossil fuels subsidies reform policy in Iran. For this aim, qualitative study and quantitative research approaches were employed, existing studies were collected and reviewed with the use of a synthesis matrix. Then the reviewed studies were examined to evaluate the GHG emissions reduction effects and potentials of fossil fuels subsidies reform policy at the global level and other countries. Followingly, the results of Targeted Subsidies Act were collected and analyzed by employing environmental policy framework and economic frameworks. Findings of this thesis demonstrate that fossil fuels subsidies have environmental consequences and costs for countries and reforming them leads to GHG emissions reduction. Iran did not implement its fossil fuels subsidies reform policy as it was aimed, and energy carriers’ end-user prices did not meet targets. Partial implementation of this policy did not lead to a decrease in energy consumption and GHG emissions reduction. For having a successful fossil fuels subsidies reform policy, complementary policies need to be implemented both in domestic and global level in parallel. National decision-makers need to consider their domestic social, environmental, political and economic context and implement the most appropriate package of policies.

Parametric insurance products aimed at providing financial assistance to individuals and communities after an extreme weather event have been promoted in the country as a strategy to increase their capacity to adapt to a changing climate.

For the successful transition, it is necessary to decarbonise the energy system by reducing CO2 emissions and ensuring a security of supply. Therefore, the aim of this thesis has been to build a secure and low-carbon energy system while identifying the optimal energy mix in the largest economies of Europe with an outlook to 2050. This study analyses and compares the approaches of Germany, France and the United Kingdom to achieve decarbonisation targets defined in their respective energy transition plans by 2030 and 2050. This research describes the methodology of using the analytical transition framework where historical decarbonisation trends during 1990-2015 have been analysed to determine the energy consumption patterns. Further, a modelling framework is used where scenarios are developed for secure and low carbon energy future. Both the historical and future trends have been analysed considering the five key elements of energy transition i.e. energy supply side, energy demand side, CO2 emissions reduction, security of supply, and renewables in electricity generation. The obtained results show that all the three countries shift from fossil fuel to low carbon energy supply sources, reduces their energy demand, reduces the CO2 emissions, reduces the fossil fuel import, and increases the share of renewables in electricity generation. Further, the study suggests that the decarbonisation of the energy system is possible with expansion of renewable energy sources, deployment of low carbon technologies, electrification of end-use sectors, and increase in energy efficiency. The thesis concludes that all the three European countries have successfully achieved their decarbonisation targets and transition to a low carbon economy by 2050.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This paper evaluates the ongoing ban in El Nido through an investigation of the peopleâ€™s compliance as well as a waste characterization survey. Insights from interviews determine that compliance is largely lacking, except in particular barangays where enforcement and continued monitoring as well as community acceptance is strong. The waste characterization survey shows that the ban helps eliminate plastic straws and bags as waste as although bottled water is still highly used, due mainly because of unsafe groundwater issues in El Nido. A map of compliance shows that serious attention needs to be given to the lack of compliance in barangays Bebeladan, Bagong Bayan, Manlag, and Teneguiban. Overall, the ban should be part of a multi-prong approach to reducing plastic waste. Stakeholders need to collaborate on solutions that considers the economic realities of places such as El Nido.

A large quantity of these emissions stem from its fossil-fuel reliant energy sector. Renewable energy sources (RES) like solar and wind power show promise in helping the country transition to cleaner forms of energy generation. India currently has ambitious plans of installing 175 GW of energy generation capacity from RES by 2022, 100 GW of which will be from the solar power sector. Apart from having lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, RES also create numerous employment opportunities for local communities. A large number of these directly created jobs are in the construction and operations and management phases of the projects. Existing literature estimates the overall number of jobs the solar power sector will create on a national level in the future. However, the distribution of these jobs varies greatly at the state and regional levels due to differing geographical and socio-political factors. This thesis attempts to fill this knowledge gap by comparing estimated solar power potential of each of the Indian states, with their job creation potential based on current government plans and policies. Further, media reports can often insinuate that these newly created “green” jobs can act as an offset to any traditional fossil fuel jobs that are lost. However, they lack a comprehensive comparison of the nature of the employment generated by the two sectors. This study compares the two kinds of jobs, based on quantity, skill type and geographical location. Lastly, this study also explores how the number and nature of these jobs can be expected to change in the next few decades.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Many European cities are considering integrating SuDS features to their stormwater management practices. More frequent weather events and water quality issues have emerged among the main drivers to advance the discussion on innovative ways to handle stormwater, especially in urban environments where the proportion of impervious surface significantly alters natural drainage patterns. Due to the relative novelty of the SuDS scheme, promoters of its components struggle with uncertainties and reluctance to change of key actors involved in making decisions about stormwater management. In this context, this thesis intends to reveal some key conditions that are necessary for the implementation of SuDS, by focusing on the planning process of stormwater management taking Tallinn city as a case study. It highlights opportunities but also key barriers that must be addressed to include SuDS into the urban landscape and planning decisions. The methodology of the research project includes a literature review on the SuDS concept, as well as an overview of the stormwater regulatory environment in Tallinn that helps put the SuDS adoption in context. To address its first objective, this research borrowed elements from theories of innovation diffusion and technology acceptance to investigate how perceptions of SuDS techniques’ attributes influence decision-makers’ attitudes towards their adoption as well as the determinants driving adoption in Tallinn case. A key feature of this first research objective was a survey conducted among stormwater planners, engineers and other relevant stakeholders. The survey results showed that a favorable perception of SuDS usefulness, ease of use, and benefits on the stakeholders’ side is likely to support and favor its adoption. While perceived insufficient resources could negatively influence intention toward adoption. Other relevant findings include some of the most significant barriers that currently hinder SuDS implementation. Furthermore, the study investigated whether a proposed geospatial approach could help detect flood-susceptible areas at the city scale. To validate the method, a comparison was performed with prior flood points. From the obtained results and analysis, a number of flood-prone locations were selected as potential SuDS sites. This led to the third objective of the research, which was to demonstrate the usefulness of a conceived planning method to help decision-makers select possible SuDS solutions depending on the site’s characteristics, SuDS benefits to prioritise and local preferences. Results from both approaches are promising as early stage, first assessment tools in SuDS planning practice which can be applied in order to first find suitable SuDS locations and then identify site-specific SuDS measures to address stormwater challenges. Based on the findings and valuable information included in this thesis, the proponents of SuDS techniques will be better prepared to foster the diffusion of these strategies at the city level. Recommendations for policy measures as well as suggestions for future research are provided as well.

A theoretical framework was developed through the lens of dialogism in critical pedagogy, framing knowledge not as an object to be exchanged, but embedded in the subject themselves. Meaningful dialogue is then formed through a subject-subject relationship, where knowledge is tied to the cultural, social, and biophysical environment of the people. Further, the role of language in dialogue forms an important theoretical pillar of the framework and is examined in the case. Consultation transcripts were analyzed through this theoretical framework using qualitative and quantitative methods. The analysis is primarily qualitative, using quotes to identify particular aspects of the consultation that led to gaps between epistemologies. Comments from the transcript relevant to the framework were coded to demonstrate epistemological trends in comments made in Inuktitut that 1) contained knowledge qualifiers and 2) were told as narratives. 44.5% of total comments were in Inuktitut, while 62.5% of knowledge qualifiers and 78.3% of narratives were in Inuktitut.

Achieving the SDGs requires near universal uptake, yet there is a scant amount of academic research regarding the contributions that civil society organizations (CSOs) can make to further SDG progress. The present work investigates the role that the Bolivian network of environmental CSOs Environmental Defense League (LIDEMA) plays in furthering Bolivia’s progress towards SDG achievement by using SDG 15 (terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems) as an entry point. Surveys and interviews were used to gather data to assess whether and how the network has collectively contributed to SDG 15 since 2015, as well as to identify plans to make future SDG 15 contributions and ascertain the capacities needed to make such future contributions. This study finds that LIDEMA members contribute to multiple SDGs in Bolivia, and their contributions to SDG 15 cover a range of targets that supplement existing implementation efforts and help to fill data and implementation gaps. At the same time, the organizations reported that their work related to SDG 15 has decreased in the post-2015 period, owing largely to external factors such including an ‘obstructed’ civic space and changes in international financing structures. This study demonstrates that there is ample room to enhance CSO contributions to the SDGs in Bolivia, but doing so demands changes from a range of actors.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

As several options have been put forward to rehabilitate the dumpsite, this research targets the surrounding potentially contaminated agricultural lands. Contrary to engineered-based methods, phytoremediation presents low-tech, low-energy, inexpensive and green technology to clean-up and regenerate contaminated soils. This study aims at exploring the factors, which influence phytoremediation acceptability from the perspectives of public, farmers as well as experts. A mixed-methods approach was adopted where quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to address different involved stakeholders. A survey was carried out with 70 residents from “Deir Qanoun Ras el Ein” Municipality. Besides, semi-constructed in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 farmers and seven experts. The study findings have shown that risk perception, trust and values affect public acceptability of phytoremediation. As for farmer’s acceptance of the technology, it is similarly influenced by risk perception and trust in addition to benefit perception, provision of livelihood alternative and socio-economic factors. On the decision-making level, phytoremediation acceptability is determined by cost-efficiency, familiarity as well as public acceptance.

In this regard a growing field of interest is the quantification of PA ecological effectiveness, often expressed in terms of avoided deforestation achieved relative to unprotected areas. However, such assessments are confounded by biases in both the non-random siting of PAs within landscapes as well as differential pressure upon their resources. These biases can be overcome by the use of quasi-experimental counterfactual study designs, that evaluate the impact of PAs against control areas of ‘similar’ biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. To contribute towards this knowledge domain this study presents an assessment of PA effectiveness for the Southeast Asian nation Cambodia, which, in light of its history of natural resource management, represents a pertinent case study. PA effectiveness was analysed using propensity score matching for three different outcome periods between 2010-2018 with the results finding significant positive treatment effects in each, with forested land in PAs being as much as 8% less likely to be deforested than similar unprotected forest. In addition to this a significant positive spillover effect of PAs was observed in 5km buffers zones adjacent to their boundaries, resulting in a maximum of 4% reduction in probability of deforestation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of PAs in Cambodia was found to vary under differential deforestation pressure as well as with regards to the duration of time since PA establishment.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This thesis aims to understand how entrepreneurs place their businesses within the wider context of sustainable development, respond to internal or external pressures, and engage with sustainability in practice through the business model. The study follows an interpretative phenomenological analysis that relies on a case study of two start-ups which build their business on a 60-year-old and once disruptive innovation, the shipping container. Given the interest in both organizational and individual aspects for change, the conceptual framework is grounded in the assumption that the business model is the mechanism for converting vison and strategy into practice and generate value. This study proposes the Framework for Sustainability- driven Business Creation, Development and Transition which describes the essential stages of the entrepreneurial approach to sustainability in business. The findings suggest that entrepreneurial motives and values are essential variables that determine the perception of and approach to sustainability, and frame efforts to balance and optimise at times competing economic, social and ecological aspirations.

While most existing research has focused on the early stages, the more advanced stages are less well understood. This thesis bridges this gap through an analysis of the recent slowdown in growth of onshore wind power in Germany – a renewable energy technology struggling in its later growth stages. On the basis of growth modelling, interviews, content and data analysis, three research objectives are pursued: (1) determining whether growth of onshore wind power is in persistent decline in Germany, (2) analysing the industry’s growth expectations to explain the wide-spread perception of the slowdown as a crisis and (3) identifying the underlying barriers to growth. The results find the technology’s long-term growth to be nearly linear, with no evidence of acceleration nor decline. The recent slowdown is mainly understood as a temporary fluctuation following the recent switch from feed-in tariffs to auctions. The crisis narrative is explained by the industry’s past growth experiences, its recent struggles, the perceived growth potential and normative scenarios for onshore wind power’s role in Germany’s energy transition. Future growth is unlikely to exceed the long-term growth rate of 3 GW, being limited by land constraints, political, institutional and social opposition, clashes with conservation and administrative barriers. Immediate action is required for lifting growth to the rates required by Germany’s climate targets. Understanding the identified growth challenges will also be essential to facilitate growth of other renewables at advanced stages of growth.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Five frontrunners are driving growth, with the United Kingdom and Germany as lead markets, and Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands as smaller competitors. Together, these countries – all members of the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NESC) – are shifting the boundaries of the energy transition from land to sea. The NESC has set a 2030 target of 76GW, up from 22GW; however, the feasibility of reaching this ‘Milestone’ remains underexplored in the literature. To date, few studies have examined the mechanisms that drive offshore wind growth beyond early market formation. To bridge this knowledge gap, this thesis examines past deployment trends to model the parameters of future growth pathways, assessing the potential for exponential, logistic and/or logistic-linear growth in the NESC. Feasibility is assessed by assessing the drivers behind offshore wind growth: techno-economic, socio-technical, and political mechanisms, against the parameters of the model.

This exploratory study integrated and analysed two datasets on electricity generating coal units worldwide to map the trajectories of 32 national coal fleets and 6 main coal consuming regions. These trajectories were evaluated through a novel framework combining theories on technology diffusion with notions of technology decline and abandonment. The principle findings were that, generally, units built since 1970 increased in size, adopted more efficient combustion technologies, and became increasingly likely to be privately owned. Geographically, the rate of units being constructed in Asia increased dramatically while simultaneously falling in Europe and North America. Overall, countries are in different phases of the coal technology lifecycle, exemplified by varying trajectories of total installed capacity and net annual capacity growth over the last 40-60 years. Contributing to the discussion on global coal decline, this study observed that total installed coal capacity for several countries demonstrates an inverse S-curve of technology diffusion with coal fleets shrinking slowly at first, but then more rapidly. Lastly, load factors (average utilization rates) were found be lower in contracting rather than growing coal fleets. These spatio-temporal patterns in coal capacity should be compared to trends in other coal-related sectors, such as heat provision or mining, to provide further insights into how the global phase-out of coal can be achieved.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Two such interventions, namely land reform and contract farming, are heavily disputed among scholars for their threats of exploiting rural dwellers and mechanisms for poverty alleviation and land tenure security. In this study, land reform and contract farming implemented in Kenya are examined according to their implications on the sustainability of rural livelihoods and the roles of actors influencing outcomes, with the overall aim to determine their feasibility in meeting the needs of small-scale producers. Through the application of a hybrid conceptual framework integrating sustainable livelihoods, political ecology, and access on diverse perspectives collected from a literature review and semi-structured interviews with researchers and practitioners, a set of findings emerged determining internal and external mechanisms constraining access to and use of land among rural livelihoods. These mechanisms and outcomes include: profit-oriented motives across micro and macro levels of actors prompting environmental damage and land commodification; absent decentralized support increasing vulnerability to crises; exclusion of impoverished communities; opaque centralized decision- making processes; and appropriation of land functions by domestic private and public actors.

In South Africa, where 79% of the country is privately owned, private PAs have become an important vehicle to increase both the total PA network and the representation of threatened ecosystems. However, despite their increasing extent and recognition, little is known about their management effectiveness. While South Africa has evaluated most of its state-owned PAs using an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), to date, only a handful of private PAs have been evaluated with the same tool. Since private PAs are diverse in terms of biodiversity features, management approaches and objectives, using a standardised tool that has been adapted for state-owned PAs is not considered appropriate. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to determine whether the Modified Threat Reduction Assessment (MTRA) is a more appropriate tool for private PAs. To determine this, first the public trust doctrine which is embedded in South Africaâ€™s environmental law was investigated, questionnaires were then used to gauge the opinions of the stakeholders involved with the implementation of METT and to determine the accompanying challenges. Lastly after comparing the TRA Index with that of the METT scores from the same private PA it was determined that the MTRA can be considered a better alternative. Institutional challenges and capacity problems prevents the METT from being implemented according to best practice guidelines. The MTRA was found to provide more benefits and less administrative challenges for private PA management.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In the same period, the number of vehicles in the developing world is expected to double. One of the ways to reconcile this tension is to increase the share of electric vehicles. However, the transition to electric transport in developing countries has been slow. Therefore, it is essential to understand whether, under what conditions, and which E-mobility support policies can be feasible and effective. This thesis advances the understanding of feasible E-mobility strategies in developing countries. Using Armenia as a case-study, it seeks to answer three questions: (1) how cost-effective and affordable are electric vehicles (EVs) for different types of consumers, (2) which feasible policies can make EVs more attractive, and (3) what effects they would have. The thesis concludes that EVs are still more expensive than conventional vehicles for private consumers, mainly because of higher upfront costs. For the public sector, EVs in Armenia can provide significant savings, due to their extensive usage and low electricity costs. A review of EV policies in five Eastern European EU states has demonstrated the range of monetary and non-monetary incentives that can be feasibly adopted in Armenia. The analysis has shown that up to a 1.8% share of EV sales may be achievable within the next five years with the introduction of ambitious monetary stimulus policies, awareness raising campaigns, and supportive regulations.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Since improved implementation capacities have been linked to better environmental outcomes, the thesis aimed at exploring how capacities of national governments to implement environmental goals can be assessed. As countries are gearing up for realizing environmental SDGs, addressing implementation capacity gaps could contribute to progress towards these goals. The research hypothesizes that the assessment of implementation capacities of national governments can offer insights into how these capacities can be improved through the process of policy learning. Via studying goal formulation and implementation practices related to earlier international environmental goals, the research aimed at identifying key factors of implementation capacity and attached to them, a set of implementation capacity indicators, as potential elements of a composite implementation capacity index. The identification of implementation capacity factors started with a document review of the MDG7 implementation experience of 20 Southeast Asian and Southeast European countries. As a next step, with the use of a questionnaire to over 100 policymakers and policy practitioners in the studied regions and an indicator development exercise, these factors were then condensed into 15 implementation capacity indicator clusters as potential elements of a composite implementation capacity index. At a more theoretical level, lessons have been gathered about how qualitative aspects of implementation capacities of governments can be measured more comprehensively and how the results of these assessments may be applied. The research found that consideration should be given to striking a balance between the complexity inherent in capacity issues, the need for robustness in how they are represented in assessments and their actual applicability in practice. It was also concluded that for the sake of transparency and for ensuring stronger ownership of indices and indicator sets, indicator selection and index design should involve intended future users throughout the development processes of such tools.

Their engagement and resistance to the full SDG narrative legitimize regional SDGs process and the intergovernmental system.

This question is even more pressing for regional regimes for which very little is known about their effectiveness and interactions. The overarching aim of this dissertation is to understand if and how a regional environmental regime can contribute to global environmental governance by examining the Carpathian Convention over its first 15 years. Combining quantitative social network analysis methods (affiliation-based bipartite network, survey-based social network, citation-based ego-network analysis) with qualitative analysis of participant observation and semi-structured interviews provides the basis for analysing of the structure and functioning of the Carpathian Convention’s networks. The dissertation develops propositions for how the structural and functional characteristics of regime actors’ social network can be linked to the outcomes of the regime, and what roles regional regimes can play in regime interactions. At the theoretical level, this dissertation concludes that the network driving forces of homophily and triadic closure may lead to the swift emergence of a core-periphery network in regional regimes due to the smaller number and more homogenous group of actors that characterises regional regimes. It also claims that the network structural effects of activities carried out by regime actors can have both positive and negative implications for regime outcomes. Finally, it suggests four mechanisms through which regime interactions affect regime outputs and outcomes: desk-top, yo-yo, hands-in-hands and stowaway. These theoretical propositions suggest pathways for future research. At the empirical level the dissertation shows how the Carpathian Convention’s actors’ network evolved into a core-periphery network, with a small number of highly connected organizations and several loosely attached peripheral actors. It points to ambiguities in leadership and highlights activities core actors implement to strengthen social cohesion. With regards to regime interactions, the research finds that the Carpathian Convention connects to 39 other regimes and organizations, albeit through different mechanisms. The dissertation concludes that regional regimes, based on their unique characteristics can act as a stepping stone in the global environmental governance system and can enhance environmental change.'}"

It examines the questions of environmental ethics from the perspective of human character and virtues. Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi is a 13th century Muslim mystic (Sufi) whose works and teachings have gained world-wide popularity in recent decades. Rumi’s views have also been the subject of some ecological analysis suggesting their significance for environmental themes. In this context, this research explores the possibility of constructing a notion of EVE from Rumi’s mystical thought. The environmental role model approach has been widely employed by EVE scholars. Some prominent figures such as Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson have been studied as environmentally virtuous personalities. This study proposes Rumi as the first non-Western, Muslim thinker whose teachings and personal example may serve as a philosophical framework and source of inspiration for cultivating environmentally sensitive mindsets, attitudes and patterns of behaviour.  Virtues should be considered holistically since they do not operate in a vacuum. They rather function within a particular philosophical background and in relation to other character traits. As such holistic notions of EVE are generally more sensitive and responsive to broader contexts. Therefore, this research aims to construct Rumi’s model of EVE based on a holistic approach which consists of three pillars: cosmological framework (including images of nature), conception of human flourishing and comprehensive account of virtues and vices. Moreover, since Rumi’s life and worldview predate the environmental era, understanding the environmental implications of his broader philosophy, as required by the holistic approach, is instrumental to establishing a link between his virtues and environmental themes.  The ecological value of Rumi’s views is premised on a theocentric vision of reality. It is articulated through certain images of nature such as the conception of nature as the cosmic Self-manifestation of the Divine and the ideas of all-encompassing love and spiritual vitality in nature. Attaining such perception of reality is contingent on a certain state of mind and character which is the goal of the process of inner transformation in Rumi. Therefore, Rumi’s virtues and vices are ecologically relevant for both their direct impact on nature and their role in leading self-transformation. Virtues, conceived as drivers of such transformation, may lead their possessor to (a) perceive the deeper non-material dimension of nature, (b) relate to it with a sense of respect, humility and appreciation, and (c) take responsibility for its well-being and preservation.', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The research concentrates on two case studies: Veps in Karelia (Northwestern Russia) and Soiots in Buriatia (South-Central Siberia). Both indigenous minorities have historical ties with mining industry including diabase and quartzite in Karelia and graphite and jade in Buriatia. The changes of post-Soviet period such as the closure of state mining enterprises in Karelia and the boost of industrial development, including informal mining, in Buriatia had impact on the articulations of indigeneity in both case studies. The dissertation shows that indigenous status recognition in post-Soviet Karelia and Buriatia is closely connected to having larger control over land and resources. To retain this control, community members need to construct their indigenous identities in the firm terms defined by Russian law. At the same time, local connections to land and resources in Karelia and Buriatia influence the character of indigenous claims and question the established state narratives, e.g. through engagement in informal mining activities. Strong ties of Veps with the stoneworking industry, as well as the sacrality of landscape in Soiot and Oka Buriat culture influence the formation of resource identities which are based on local resources and become an additional resource themselves.  The research demonstrates that the relations between indigenous communities and mining may go beyond the established dichotomies of “traditional” versus “industrial” or “indigenous person” versus “mining worker.” The dissertation produces a thorough analysis of the links between the construction of resource and the construction of indigenous subject.

Manifold governments and corporations represent their commercial buildings as concrete evidence of their engagement with socially accepted values of energy saving, which buildings are thus assumed to contribute to fostering public awareness and the replication of related practices. This would contribute to bridging the gap between the actual adoption of practices and the potential for this, the latter claims based on techno-economic grounds and the widespread acceptance of energy saving values. However, there is limited scholarly and policy reflection about these assumptions. Such appears to be the case with the EU “exemplary” requirements for commercial buildings. My purpose is to contribute to “re-cognising” commercial buildings as co-producing the meaning and practice of energy saving, thereby contributing to bridging the epistemological gap between policies and everyday life. Tackling this requires a radical critique of the knowledge and interests underlying the marginal recognition of buildings as mediating the (re)production of practice.  In acknowledging critical reviews of energy saving conceptualisations and practices as decontextualising instruments which have a legitimating function and a de-politicising effect, this study was inspired by Lefebvre’s theory about the production of space. For Lefebvre, commercial buildings rely on positivist epistemologies to represent a practice and contribute to the illusion that an appropriate practice is being produced, ultimately legitimating the status quo. This illusion can be countered through an appraisal of the contradictions between the conceptual, material and social dimensions of practice through a radical critique of everyday (1991). Empirically supporting such a critique requires the use of interpretive methodologies that are able to assess practices as an act of reframing. These are rare in applied policy-making and research.  The research design involved four buildings in Barcelona that were selected for empirical analysis based on their energy saving credentials, as publicized by their respective commissioning organisations. Interpretation relied on a review of official narratives; observation; pre-arranged interviews with experts and officials (n= 62), and on-the-spot interviews with users and passers-by (n= 67).  My findings reveal a divide between official and everyday framings. The study of official representations shows the prevalence of a framing of innovation and singular exemplars, whereby organisations are veiled from public scrutiny. Everyday meaning-making refers, instead, to the context of the organisation (its values, practices, and social relations) and of public replication. An appraisal of the contradictions in this context of practice counters the credibility of official claims and practices, providing a novel explanation for gaps in applied policy and research.  The policy, political, epistemological and methodological contributions of this research are intertwined as they empirically support the claim that producing a practice of energy saving requires acknowledging: a) the difference between “practice” and “reductionist representations”; b) the legitimating function of commercial buildings; c) the limits of positivist knowledge and post-structuralist critique; and, d) the potential for interpretive methodologies and orientations. Re-cognising buildings appears to be an operable mechanism for re-politicising official practice and for reframing the energy saving problem. I have reflected these contributions in a series of policy recommendations for EU policies that should foster the exploration of the potential of commercial buildings to re-contextualize energy saving practice.'}"

Due to the “conflicting” interests of humanity and farm animals however, current problem-solving efforts aim to slowly transition conventional livestock farming to more welfare-friendly systems. But studies also suggest important inconsistencies in the societal evaluation of welfare and consumer behaviours, and farmers are often blamed for using production methods that many oppose. These problems initiated theoretical disputes over “what the right thing to do” for livestock should be. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of a fragmented livestock welfare reform effort. Using the Anderson (2011) model on how truly powerless groups such as children and animals gain societal protection, it has assessed important discrepancies between animal welfare reform principles and livestock farming practices. In particular, it aimed to identify the emerging features of a united “moral imperative” and “ultimate goal” for livestock welfare, and comprehend opportunities and threats that influence the livestock welfare reform effort. A Grounded Theory approach enabled the researcher to pursue a pluralist scientific perspective in which the socially constructed nature of “reality” was integrated with an understanding of the “lived realities” of animals. A qualitative research strategy provided data from in-depth semi-structured interviews with “experts”, “conventional farmers” and “alternative farmers” and observational data from conventional and alternative pig farms in Hungary. These data sets were comparatively assessed and captured many aspects of the livestock welfare problem which was “grounded” in empirical data. Results suggest that the majority of conventional and alternative farmers have a shared understanding of “ideal” livestock welfare conditions, which only alternative farmers are able to pursue. While “ideal” conditions are believed to provide good lives for animals, farmers thought that the “realistic” scenario was probable, in which only economically advantageous aspects of welfare are ensured. Farmers believe that conventional livestock farming is unable to transition to a system that ensures all aspects of welfare, not because farmers prioritise economic benefits over livestock welfare, but rather because they are constrained by major external pressures and conventional technologies. Data suggests that a successful livestock welfare reform will depend on extending current problem-solving approaches to incorporate “external” as well as “internal” aspects of agriculture that determine farming methods and livestock welfare conditions. Emerging features of the “moral imperative” and “ultimate goal” for farm animal welfare prioritize traditional “care principles” and aim to ensure good lives for animals in small-scale, low-intensity, near-natural farming systems. It did not call for non-interference rights for livestock, but rather enhanced and mutually beneficial human-human and human-animal interactions. The study suggests that this aim could only be achieved in situations where societal consensus and cooperation are ensured. To pursue a successful livestock welfare reform effort the contribution of conventional and alternative farmers is also essential.', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

However, it is often the case that these impacts are not incorporated during the evaluation of a suitable energy assessment due to lack of mature quantification methodology. Hence, most of the time, the potential of sustainable energy policies are undervalued. Therefore, the aim of this research is to provide better tool and methods to quantify multiple impacts rigorously. In order to achieve this aim, this dissertation proposes a methodological framework and using the framework, this dissertation quantifies productivity impact in a rigorous manner for Hungary and Germany. Among these wide ranges of multiple impacts, productivity impacts are observed to be one of the biggest impacts, but despite the evidence, productivity impacts are not defined clearly in the context of multiple impacts, and hence it is also not rigorously quantified. Thus, this dissertation defines productivity impacts by defining three key aspects of labour productivity namely active days, workforce performance and earning ability which results from two different improved energy efficiency measures (HVAC system with airtight building envelope and modal shift towards active transportation):  1. The amount of active time available for productive work. This can be affected, for instance, by being sick- more precisely absenteeism and presentism, which reduce the amount of active time available. 2. Workforce performance within a certain time frame. Indoor air quality and thermal comfort of tertiary buildings can improve the mental wellbeing of the entire workforce and this can result in more productive time for work. 3. Earning ability/value added per unit of time worked. Poor indoor air quality and thermal discomfort can affect the future earning ability of a child by disrupting education.  The result shows that Germany and Hungary can gain 7.7 days/person and 3.21 days/person, year by having more deep retrofit-type residential and tertiary buildings such as deeply retrofitted buildings, passive houses, and nearly zero energy buildings. Germany and Hungary can gain 331 million and 5 million Euros/year respectively by gaining more active days due to more deep retrofit-type residential buildings. Similarly, by having more tertiary deep retrofit-type buildings, Germany and Hungary can gain 332 million and 2 million Euro/year respectively. This dissertation further shows that Germany and Hungary can gain 1870 and 3849 healthy life years/million population, year respectively by having more deep retrofit-type residential buildings. In addition to avoided sick days, by working in deep retrofit-type tertiary buildings, Germany and Hungary can gain around 85 million euro/year and 1.8 million euro/year respectively by improving the mental well-being. Lastly, this dissertation results also show that by opting for the modal shift towards active transportation, Germany and Hungary can gain 2.5 hours/driver, year and 0.5 hours/driver, year respectively. By quantifying productivity impacts this dissertation shows the significance of productivity impacts of sustainable energy policies and concluded that multiple impacts could be another incentive for a policymaker to design a sustainable energy policy.'}"

The existing global scenarios of energy transitions poorly account for economic, social, and political circumstances of individual countries. Yet a global transition can only be achieved as sum of national transitions. This thesis contributes to an understanding of energy transitions that is both nationally differentiated and globally relevant, empirically grounded, and integrates insights from relevant social science disciplines. The thesis is a conceptualization of national energy transitions as an outcome of recurring causal mechanisms within and across co-evolving systems of energy flows and markets, energy technologies, and energy policies. The thesis uses insights from techno-economic, socio-technical, and political perspectives on energy transitions to identify generic transition mechanisms and validates and refines these mechanisms, also demonstrating their explanatory power through a three-stage empirical research. The first stage is a comparative case study of energy transitions in Germany and Japan, explaining differences between the two countries in terms of causal mechanisms and their interactions. This explanation contrasts and improves on the majority of single-factor explanations in the existing literature. At the second stage, the thesis analyses early phases of wind and solar power adoption in 12 countries with diverse socio-economic circumstances, focusing on the “formative phase” mechanisms. At the third stage, the thesis analyses the introduction of wind and solar power in 60 largest electricity producers worldwide. Methodological contributions of this thesis include using the “takeoff year” when the combined share of solar and wind power first exceeds 1% of electricity supply as the dependent variable and using event history analysis for explaining global takeoff sequence. As a novel application of the mechanisms-based approach, it compares the strengths of different mechanisms across countries in terms of capacities, motivations, and interactions of state and non-state actors involved in energy transition mechanisms.  The findings of this thesis include an exceptional role of the European Union, effective governance associated with the OECD membership, high-income status, and large size of economies in low- and middle-income countries. It observes that major energy exports in non-OECD countries hinder their capacity to introduce renewables. In addition to explaining national differences, the thesis identifies a regular global pattern of renewable energy adoption, something that can be used in constructing more informative and realistic decarbonization pathways and scenarios.'}"

However, in some post-Soviet countries it has taken on an additional role of an instrument of state environmental control to some extend, and is a mandatory requirement in certain cases. This feature of environmental auditing in the countries undergoing political and economic transition has never been studied properly. Therefore, this dissertation explores a variety of environmental auditing used as an environmental policy tool in Ukraine, an example of those post-Soviet countries, and contributes to filling the existing gap in knowledge. Given these circumstances, I formulate the main research question in the following way: Why does the practice of environmental auditing in Ukraine differ from an approach commonly used in developed market economies? This main question encompasses two sub-questions: What were the driving forces behind the introduction and evolution of environmental auditing in Ukraine? What are the peculiarities of environmental auditing practices in Ukraine? To explore the practice of environmental auditing in Ukraine, I use a combination of the shift of policy paradigms theory, the collective action theory and the community of practice theory. This theoretical framework provides me with a lens to analyze the rationales for its introduction, the stages of its development, its varieties and purposes in Ukraine. My research design includes various qualitative with some elements of quantitative methods for data collection (literature review, semi-structure open-ended interviews, and participant/non-participant observations) and data analysis (coding). This combination of theoretical framework and qualitative methods focused on environmental auditing as practiced and perceived by practitioners, which may differ from a normative picture codified in laws and regulations, has never been used for investigating this policy instrument in Ukraine. Using a theory-based research, I contribute to filling the gap in scientific knowledge, as the existing literature on this topic focuses more on guidance for practitioners. This study has found that environmental auditing in Ukraine is a heterogeneous or hybrid policy instrument combining features of both command-and-control and marked-based policy tools. This phenomenon reflects a complex combination of influences of the Soviet past and international practices that shaped its development during transition to a market economy. There are two types of environmental auditing in Ukraine: mandatory, used mainly as a state control tool in the privatization of public property, and voluntary, used to improve environmental performance of organizations, typically in the context of environmental management system certification, or to identify environmental liabilities for projects involving foreign investment. These two types of environmental auditing, based on different normative documents and having different objectives, largely rely on the same practitioners – environmental auditors, who often have several certificates allowing them to conduct both procedures. The analysis of the NGO ‘Union of Environmental Auditors’ showed that, it is not a community of practice, and has been created to satisfy personal interest of particular group of individuals. Based on my findings, I provide considerations on the possible future development of environmental auditing in Ukraine, as well as avenues for my further research.', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

It creates a network of protected areas throughout the EU. Many Member States, however, have faced an inability to ‘comply’ or behave in a way that is consistent with the legislative objectives set forth in the two Directives. Unfortunately, there has been little academic research conducted on this final stage of the implementation, which is theorizing on why targets of EU policy do or do not behave in a way that is consistent with the objectives of the policy. This thesis sought to provide insight into this question through an in-depth case study analysis of Bulgaria and the deviant “Case of Wind Turbines in Coastal Dobruzha”. It was conducted through semi-structured open-ended interviews with the key informants of this controversial case, which is currently under trial in the European Court of Justice, and the analysis of primary and secondary source materials. From the analysis, two sets of conclusions were drawn. The first set of conclusions highlighted the relationship between the state and the EU. The legal transposition of the two Directives in Bulgaria was largely due to the desire for European membership. During the pre-accession phase of EU integration, insufficient resources were allocated by the EU for the policy to be implemented effectively after membership. As a result, once the relationship between the EU and the state changed from one of conditionality to regulatory cooperation, ‘massive resistance’ on a domestic level ensued due to the high domestic costs of compliance. Administrative officials in charge of implementing Natura 2000, as well as Bulgarian society as a whole, were relatively inexperienced with biodiversity conservation. At the same time, they were undergoing the ‘wild east of legislative changes’ causing enormous constraints on administrative officials and high adaptation costs. One persistent failure on a European level is the assumption that they have a ‘coalition of willing partners’ in Member States with regard to policy implementation. Therefore, preventative measures are not set up to subvert non-compliance, thus there is little the EU can do to try and obtain compliance after violations occur other than infringement proceedings. This research found that these proceedings could be largely ineffective in altering the behavior of the state. This is largely due to the length or infringement proceedings and the probability of detecting non-compliance by the Member States. Counter to contemporary political theory, the research uncovered that over time the relationship between the EU and the state can develop into a ‘de-constructivist’ learning process. Rather than learning new ideas and norms through European policy implementation, states can identify mechanisms to avoid costly policy mandates or illustrate policy implementation through ‘pseudo compliance’. This means that states can externally display compliance to minimize or delay the costs of detection by the European Commission while not intending to fully comply with legislative objectives. In addition, the multitude of EU Directives sets up a market place of European objectives that states can choose to accept or reject based on whether they align with domestic priorities. In Bulgaria, the renewable energy targets of the EU aligned with domestic priorities, and ‘mal-adaptation’ pursued as the state successfully achieved EU renewable energy targets at the expense of biodiversity conservation. European companies played a key role in capitalizing on, and exploiting, a weak state in transition to seek financial gain. This was only further exacerbated by the contradictory role European institutions played in seeking to achieve their inter-institutional priorities at the expense of the objectives of the Birds and Habitats Directive. The thesis also found that in Bulgaria administrative officials are strongly dependent on the political parties in power. Therefore, national, regional, and local administrative bodies oftentimes do not take procedurally neutral administrative decisions, but use their authority to implement decisions consistent with centralized political objectives. Therefore, the tools used for policy implementation are only as good as the intention of those that wield them. The second set of conclusions relates to the impact of Europeanization on internal domestic politics. NGOs can become empowered by European Directives that align with their policy preferences and push the state to insert these objectives into their national agenda. The state authorities, however, can resist this agenda and develop sophisticated methods for law avoidance. In order to circumvent the state, NGOs can appeal to the European Commission by filing citizens’ complaints, thus empowering the NGOs in this new political sphere of influence. Member States control financial, authoritative, organizational, and nodal tools, which can be deployed to carry out retaliatory measures against these NGOs in order to undermine their ability to effectively conduct their work. The thesis concludes that Bulgaria, like all other Member States, has unique geographic, cultural, political, and economic circumstances that became dramatically transformed through the EU approximation process. The EU must develop a holistic approach to policy-making that will not only achieve concrete goals, but also change the policy environment to one that is more favorable to new policies. Only when this is achieved can we begin to see a European system where Member States work together with European institutions to overcome domestic barriers they face in order to meet strategic objectives of European importance.', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

They need to be managed in a flexible and adaptive way. This dissertation aimed to identify which factors are conducive to strengthen the adaptive capacity of transboundary water management regimes in Europe. The concept adaptive capacity was operationalized as “Ability to cope with past flow variability without conflicts”. Adaptation activities in four European transboundary water management regimes were compared: the Rhine, Danube, Meuse, and Neman basins, complemented by short consideration of 9 additional basins worldwide. The research question was analysed in a qualitative way, using participatory observation, complemented by semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The analysis identified the following enabling factors for adaptive capacity: 1. Adaptive capacity of transboundary water management regimes can be promoted by flexible legal frameworks, flexible and well-working organizations such as river basin commissions, data and information exchange about climate change impacts, learning capacity and clarification of responsibilities between the national and transboundary levels. Usually, the transboundary level has a role to play in prevention, preparedness and reaction to flow variability, whereas responsibilities for all areas of the disaster risk management cycle and for implementation of measures lies at national level. These levels can motivate each other. 2. Legal frameworks should facilitate the other enabling factors, namely include provisions on data exchange, common monitoring and early-warning, stakeholder engagement, creation of river basin organizations, funding aspects. New legal treaties should be designed flexibly, which can however have transaction costs. 3. Flexibility in the organization responsible for ensuring implementation of the transboundary agreement, such as the river basin commission (RBO), is important for adaptive capacity and can overcome lack of flexibility in the legal framework, at least in water-rich European basins. To increase adaptive capacity flexible RBOs can set up expert groups or develop basin-wide adaptation strategies and plans. Thus, more efforts are needed for establishing and strengthening river basin commissions. 4. River basin organizations need an effective secretariat, a visionary and motivating leader, trust and understanding benefits of cooperation by the riparian countries, wide stakeholder engagement, human and financial resources for climate change adaptation and a mandate to address flow variability. 5. Exchange of data and developing basin-wide models, studies and vulnerability assessments facilitates reaching of common understanding and scientific consensus on climate change impacts, which is a precondition for increasing adaptive capacity. 6. Climate change impacts and the need for adaptation do not necessarily cause conflicts, but provide often even a motivation for cooperation.', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

In particular, the empirical research focuses on the effects of governance modes on the sustainability performance of water utilities currently operating in Armenia under various forms of public-private partnerships. The analysis explores the directional, magnitude and evolution impacts of water privatization in Armenia along sustainability dimensions: environmental, social, and economic performance. Next, the research is focusing on the impacts of water privatization on households (water access and consumption profile, service quality, coping strategies, etc.). The research also seeks to examine the structural and process changes in the water sector as an aggregate mechanism of policies, legal and regulatory procedures, organizational structures, financing and impact mitigation mechanisms. The research is based on the mixed method approach with the application of several methodological tools. The major methodological components include ex-post benchmarking method, conversational/stakeholder interviewing, document analysis, and the household survey  bottom-up participatory approach that puts people at the core of the research. Research results show that intensive marketization trends with related structural changes reinforced privatization in public services. Conditional technical and financial support from donor institutions and urgency dictated by the deteriorating infrastructure made privatization a “no other option”. Even under the “forced” conditions, transition to the public-private provision of water services in Armenia had a positive influence on the sustainability performance of all water utilities. Armenian utilities also succeed in performing well internationally. However, the scale of impact of privatization depends on the initial state of the enterprise and the local context. Supportive legislation and regulation is needed for ensuring the attractiveness and incentives for the private sector participation and operation and for protecting consumers from monopoly abuse. Furthermore, although water supply services have been improved and people are generally satisfied with water services, there are still a number of service deficiencies that households face and try to cope with by implementing a number of measures that require additional costs and/or behavioural changes. Finally, after the high return and low risk low hanging fruits are reached during the first generation reforms to meet the most urgent needs, more efforts are required for enhancing long-term sustainability and effectiveness.'}"

These initiatives became widely recognized for being able to provide viable alternatives to the classic cultivation models that used to characterize these fields, the Huerta de Valencia. The Huerta has always been a “site, medium and outcome of historically specific relations of social power” (Brenner 2009: 198). It has always played an important role in the self-definition of the Valencian regional identity. However, since the 1960’s the growth of the metropolitan area accelerated and devoured over half of the historical territory of the Huerta. Meanwhile the socio-economic viability of the remaining fields also got compromised as with such a highly fragmented land-structure they were unable to compete on an increasingly globalized food market. At the same time a strong civil movement developed for the protection of these fields. It developed a massive amount of mostly defensive discourses and most typically organized around fighting specific territorial aggressions. These agro-entrepreneurial initiatives developed cultivation and distribution models that could adapt well to the contemporary challenges present in the Huerta. They were able to address well the concerns that derived from their embeddedness, which were originally voiced by the movement for the protection of the Huerta. They also proved to have the ability to mobilize the social capital that derived from it. As the movement apparently embraced these initiatives, they are recognized as the most recent milestone in the evolution of the movement. Their proactive efforts created a strong sense of place around the Huerta. The alternative economic space developed around these initiatives assumed the challenge to keep these ‘fields alive’.

Net-zero energy/emission mandates have been mushrooming worldwide, while the expert community remains divided or at least cautious with regard to the feasibility or environmental desirability of forcing such construction/retrofit in certain cases. The aim of this research is to contribute to the debate around the NZEB concept from global and regional perspectives through analyzing the role of solar energy produced on site together with energy efficiency measures in meeting building energy demand. In order to achieve this goal a special model – BISE model – has been developed, which allows for estimating solar thermal and electric energy output from advanced building-integrated hybrid technologies taking into account various geographical, architectural, morphological and climatic parameters. This model is based on a novel methodology combining bottom-up energy modelling with geospatial analysis and outstanding visualisation techniques. A comprehensive bottom-up energy model, developed by Centre for Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Policy, has been used in order to estimate global and regional building energy demand with certain data inputs from BUENAS model (particularly for energy use by appliances and lighting). Combining the results on energy demand and potential solar energy supply provides a valuable scientific insight on the locations and building types where it is feasible to achieve the net-zero level of energy performance through application of solar technologies. The results show that realization of technical potential for state-of-the-art solar energy technologies in the building sector together with energy efficiency improvement will significantly reduce global and regional energy use and will allow for achieving net-zero energy goals in a number of locations and building types.', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Conservation experts have hence questioned the effectiveness of PAs in serving their objectives, and large efforts have been invested in improving the evaluation of Protected Area Management Effectiveness including the development of Management Effectiveness Evaluation tools. In parallel, there is growing evidence about the usefulness of adopting adaptive and collaborative management (co-management) approaches for optimizing management performance of certain types of PAs, specifically those presenting complex social-ecological systems such as Biosphere Reserves (BR). BRs are international sites designated by UNESCO under the Man and Biosphere (MAB) program launched in 1971, and intended to serve the 3 functions of conservation, socio-economic development, and logistic support (environmental education, research and monitoring). Organized into a world network with underlying regional networks, BR numbers grew to 651 in 120 countries. The implementation and management effectiveness of BRs still lack a systematic and rigorous evaluation worldwide, and specifically in Arab countries. This is partially explained by the (1) absence of a standard and appropriate set of indicators, and (2) serious pitfalls in the Periodic Review process, the only reporting requirement by UNESCO-MAB authorities. The current research addresses this challenge by studying the status of BR concept implementation and management effectiveness of BRs within the ArabMAB Network. The research utilizes a mixed methods approach that combines informal interviews, online survey, document review, and in-depth face-to-face interviews with key informants. The survey uses an innovative evaluation framework with 34 indicators developed based on an existing Common Reporting Format, allowing for comparative analysis with Global Study results of PA/BR management effectiveness. Quantitative analysis (N=17) reveals an overall management effectiveness score (6.31) greater than the global average (5.30) used as a benchmark, both falling in the “basic” management range. Factors most largely determining the management performance of Arab BRs are similar with the Global Study findings for the process-related indicators “communication programs” and “administrative processes including financial management”. Overall management effectiveness is mostly determined by achievement of outputs and outcomes in ArabMAB, in contrast with input and processes in the Global Study. Combining results of the mixed methods approach, the dissertation identifies 7 priority areas for the improvement of concept implementation and management effectiveness of Arab BRs: \uf0a7 Communication, collaboration and cooperation \uf0a7 ArabMAB institutional gaps \uf0a7 Understanding and differentiation of the BR concept \uf0a7 Integration and mainstreaming of the MAB program \uf0a7 Involvement and participation of local communities \uf0a7 Evaluation of biosphere reserve management v \uf0a7 Capacity and resources (cross-functional) Recommendations are developed for both addressing these challenges, and improving the evaluation of BR management effectiveness in the Arab region.

The loss of territoriality means that indigenous governments face unique obstacles to self-governance that do not affect other local governments in Alaska or indigenous tribes in the continental United States. This dissertation relies on archival and legal research to analyze how these obstacles developed. Using legal and interpretative policy analysis, this research reveals four specific impacts that occur when local governments lose the authority to govern the lands and resources upon which their communities depend. First, governments lose the capacity to govern for their community’s food security. Second, Alaska tribes cannot seek to regulate environmental quality. Third, Alaska tribal governments are unable to create policies that promote resilience to climate change. Finally, the capacity for tribal governments to protect public safety is restricted because of the lack of territorial authority. These losses create obstacles to the capacity of tribal communities to govern for the wellbeing of their community that are compounded by complex systems of state and federal governance. These obstacles hinder the ability of Alaska Native tribes to exercise the right of self- determination and the capacity to promulgate policies that promote fate control and other Arctic human development goals. This dissertation uses qualitative research methods to examine the two-fold response to the loss of territoriality. First, using participant observation and key-informant interviews, this dissertation presents a case study of how one tribal organization is working to build systems that “hold people up instead of holding them back” through promoting shared governance and co- management of water quality and climate change science. The Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (YRITWC) is an international, inter-tribal consortium of Alaska Tribes and Canadian First Nations that seeks to support its member tribes in asserting the sovereign right to co-govern the water quality of the Yukon River basin. Second, using archival research and observation, this dissertation assesses the responses of the state and federal governments to the efforts of Alaska tribes to increase self-governance, including legislative approaches to expand territorial and non-territorial tribal authority.  This dissertation concludes that the loss of territoriality impedes the ability of tribes to exercise the human right of self-determination, and that states and federal governments have a commensurate obligation to recognize those rights This dissertation also concludes that the loss of land based governance impacts on the capacity of local tribal governments to promulgate policies that promote human development and wellbeing. To remedy the impacts to human rights and human development, this dissertation suggests integrating adaptive co-management regimes that structurally share power and authority with Alaska tribes.'}"

Paradigm changes are implemented in societies first and foremost through a redefinition of indicators. Our current indicator systems do not take into account the complexity of human social, economic and material systems and prioritize “efficiency” and “growth”. The objective of this research was to develop an indicator for one type of anthropogenic complex systems, i.e. cities that took into account the complex nature of the system and provided a quantitative way to prioritize alternative values such as “resilience” and “sustainability”. Scaling has been identified as one measure of complexity in a system, which is relatively easy to compute and comprehend. Here, I have developed a scaling indicator for cities based on fractal dimension. US block wise census data was used to calculate the exponent of the power-law distribution of population density across different census blocks in a city. The power-law, or scaling indicator, herein referred to as the fractal dimension was then compared to parameters such as population, area, population density, gasoline sales, gasoline sales per capita and area, and carbon emissions and carbon emissions per capita. It was noted that the fractal dimension had a power-law correlation with gasoline sales per unit area in the cities. The analysis was then extended a second complex system, i.e. national economies. Fractal dimension or scaling of percentages of incomes across the highest earning to lowest earning twenty percent segments of the population was calculated using World Bank economic data for 2004 (the year for which most extensive dataset was available). The relationship between this scaling indicator and energy usage per capita in countries was again found to be a power-law with an r-square value of more than 0.35 (similar to the correlation between urban fractal dimension and gasoline sales per area in cities). A new planning tool is developed to allow incorporation of consideration of these complexity indicators in development planning for cities and national economies. The planning-plane allows for visualization of the impacts of particular interventions in cities (e.g. housing scheme) and economies (e.g. changes in tax-code) on energy consumption parameters across two independent variables (e.g. population and fractal dimension) instead of the usual practice of using one indicator (e.g. population density). The similar nature of the correlation between scaling indicators and energy consumption indicators in two completely different anthropogenic complex systems hints at some underlying similarity in the mechanism through which these complex systems develop. It is hypothesized here that steeper scaling (e.g. higher income differences in economies) in complex systems makes good system regulation more energy intensive, thereby affecting the energy consumption parameters as observed in this study. Steeper scaling also thus negatively affects the effectiveness of regulation in complex systems and makes the system more prone to internal shocks. Planning system evolution for resilience would thus benefit from consideration of scaling indicators in the planning process.', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

It focuses on fuel (or energy) poverty, a situation in which a household is unable to afford sufficient domestic energy services and/or is forced to pay a disproportionate share of its income on domestic energy. Fuel poverty is understood as a combined social, environmental and energy challenge whose alleviation results in considerable welfare gains for the affected population. Taking Hungary as a case study, the dissertation has assessed the extent, causes and characteristics of fuel poverty in Hungaryand conducted a cost-benefit analysis of two scenarios proposing a significant upgrade of Hungaryâ€™s currently existing residential energy efficiency policies.  One first key conclusion is that fuel poverty, which is affecting a substantial fraction (between 10 to 30%) of the Hungarian population, has been on the rise since the mid-2000s in parallel to arapid increase in the price of imported natural gas. Faced with this situation, households are resorting to the use of traditional fuels and other imperfect coping strategies harming their welfare in various ways. Collected evidence has also identified two previously unreported typologies of fuel poverty (among poor Roma households in rural areas and in prefabricated panel buildings connected to district heating) that defy conventional notions of fuel poverty as defined in Western Europe.  Even though household incomes and energy prices are important causes of fuel poverty, the energy performance of residential buildings is regarded as a key structural factor and lever for its solution. Based on this premise, the dissertation has assessed through a financial and social cost-benefit analysis (CBA) two residential energy efficiency scenarios: MID (40% energy savings for heating per dwelling) and DEEP (79 to 90% energy savings for heating per dwelling). In the financial CBA only monetary cash flows (retrofit costs and energy savings benefits) are considered. In the social CBA, building retrofit and program management costs (as transaction costs) are compared against energy saving and other non-market benefits (avoided GHG and non-GHG emissions, reduced fuel poverty-related excess winter mortality and comfort benefits).  The results of the social CBA indicate that even though MID scenario delivers positive Net Present Values (NPV) at an earlier stage, DEEP retrofits delivers a larger amount of discounted net social benefits in the long term (from 2040). Compared with the financial CBA, the social CBA results in earlier positive NPVs for both scenarios and enhances the appeal of DEEP retrofits from an applied policy perspective. This comparison evidences the relevance of fuel poverty-related non-market co-benefits in contexts where domestic energy costs are on the rise and/or a heavy burden on household budgets.  This multi-dimensional analysis of the effects residential energy efficiency emphasises the importance of the co-benefits as policy entry-points for advancing the implementation of advanced residential energy efficiency solutions. In countries with moderate levels of commitment to global climate goals and high or increasing fuel poverty rates, these results may contribute to redefining the rationale behind climate investments.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (4838k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Decarbonisation options include importing solar electricity from the Middle East and North Africa through a long-distance transmission system, a Supergrid. Such imports raise questions about energy security: will Europe become vulnerable to coercion and embargoes, or to terrorist attacks and extreme natural events? In this dissertation, I assess the impacts of a Supergrid scenario (Desertec) on European energy security in comparison with the present situation, a business-as-usual and a decarbonisation scenario from the Global Energy Assessment. First, I define energy security as ‘low vulnerability of vital energy systems’. I contextualise this generic definition by identifying which vital energy systems and vulnerabilities are priorities in the European context, based on an analysis of empirically observed policy measures. European energy security policy focuses on mitigating physical supply disruptions and excessive price volatility, caused by a small number of threats to national and regional electricity and gas systems. I could not identify any environmental or social aspects of energy security. Second, I develop and apply new methods for assessing the vulnerability to energy coercion, infrastructure failures and terrorism in scenarios. I base these methods on the ideas of power balances, chokepoint failures, action attractiveness to hostile states and non-state actors, and energy system resilience. I show that all scenarios and the present system are well-diversified and sufficiently resilient, which makes them not vulnerable to coercion or chokepoint failures. No single country has power to coerce Europe, as single-country export cuts inflict high and sustained costs on the exporters themselves, but not on Europe. Single-country interruptions cause costly but short-lived end-use outages in Desertec, but not in the present system or in the other scenarios. However, if embargoes are coordinated among the majority of electricity or gas exporters, the costs for Europe may be both sustained and higher than for the exporters in Desertec, the other scenarios and the present system. Similarly, 3-5 failures of energy import chokepoints would cause short end-use outages in Desertec but not in the present system or the other scenarios. Large and lasting outages only follow 10 or more simultaneously disabled chokepoints. However, disabling a large number of chokepoints and causing lasting end-use outages is difficult, making energy infrastructure an unattractive terrorist target. Likewise, simultaneous failures of multiple chokepoints are very unlikely outcomes of natural or technical events. Thus, I show that the Desertec scenario does not cause significant worsening of European energy security, related to the two assessed threats, compared to today or to the other scenarios. I obtain these results by novel, context- and threat-specific methods, and the results are in partial contrast to assessments using the widely used but generic diversity indices also carried out here. Further research may build on this dissertation with a more detailed representation of (a) energy security policy concerns (beyond reflection on policy measures), (b) coercion events (taking into account ‘political’ costs and actors’ willingness to accept damage), and (c) alternative terrorist motivations (beyond causing outages).', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (5148k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The study is based on data collected using ethnographic unstructured in-depth interviews, participant observation, critical reading of popular books on Prespa written by Prespiots, documents and newspaper reports on various events and issues concerning Prespa. Because place situates the perspective from which people assign meaning to their biophysical and the social environment, they may adopt different positions on an environmental issue in the watershed, depending on the importance of a particular place-based identity. This research demonstrated that meanings ascribed to the biophysical environment are part and parcel of the construction of place-based identities at multiple spatial levels such as the home, village, region, and beyond. The family and the home constitute the core of meanings which individuals assign to elements and processes operating in the biophysical and the social environment at a variety of geographical scales. At larger geographical scales the experience of place is more likely to be mediated by pre-established constructs of place rather than by direct experience. The biophysical environment is involved in the tensions between the dominant constructs of Prespaâ€™s identity: an ethnic place, a tourist center, and a place of man and nature. The implication of the findings of this research is that the proponents of ecosystem-based management in Prespa need to expand their analysis beyond mere technical problems and scientific concerns with ecosystem services provisioning and provide for the extended and authentic participation of stakeholders in order to develop policies that take place-based meanings into account.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2551k)'}"

Facing this challenge, problem solving at all levels of government needs to embrace the opportunities for learning in a multi-stakeholder context. This thesis is a study on how municipalities in Hungary develop their capacity for addressing sustainability. I argue that this learning process for sustainability is much embedded in the local organizational culture. Municipalities with a culture more open to dialogue and inquiry will tend to be more successful in developing meta-knowledge to deal with substantive and strategic complexities. I argue that this learning process is facilitated by the informal advice relationships municipal departments maintain in their social network. In addressing my research problem, I took a quantitative approach. Based on a theoretical model specifying the key factors of learning for sustainability and their hypothesized relationships, I drew data via a survey from 161 Hungarian municipal departments involved in some aspect of local policy in one of 19 cities. Using various multivariate statistical techniques, I explored the patterns of advice seeking between departments and I also estimated a path model to test my hypotheses on organizational factors of learning for sustainability. My findings indicate that informal relationships are important in delivering opportunities to municipal departments to learn about problems. Unfortunately, interaction with other actors is dominantly motivated by political benefits (securing approval). Actors with a perceived potential to reformulate problems are peripheral. A learning oriented culture was found to have a substantial direct influence on generating meta-knowledge for sustainability. But it was also found to have a positive mediated effect on learning by facilitating informal communication with actors and also motivating departments to build more diverse advice networks. My results draw the attention to the often neglected or downplayed role of organizational factors in developing local government capacity to address issues in a sustainable way. The importance of informal relationships and soft factors such as building trust, a shared identity and an organizational culture open to dialogue and inquiry highlight the responsibility of local leadership and public management in advancing municipalities towards a more sustainable future.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2748k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Natural concentrations of arsenic are found in groundwater and soil systems throughout the world. Where these groundwater resources are used as a source of drinking water, people are exposed to arsenic, presenting a threat to human health. In order to prevent these health impacts, the EU sets a limit of 10 ppb (Î¼g/l) arsenic in drinking water. The limit is adopted by all member states. Hungary heavily relies on drinking water sourced from high-arsenic groundwater. However, despite adopting the EU limits, much of the water delivered exceeds 10 ppb, putting approximately one quarter of the population at risk from arsenic-related health problems. This thesis seeks to explain this governance failure. The results show that governance failures are created when policy actors do not adjust their beliefs to match those incorporated into the policies and institutional structures of the EU. Resistance to institutional adoption results from the persistence of actor beliefs incorporated under previous governance institutions, and because of the lack of information or resources available to facilitate belief change. In particular, a lack of scientific justification behind the 10 ppb limit prevents the availability of such information. These findings expand upon current understandings of structure-agency interactions of institutions in EU governance systems, and the role this plays in policy implementation. Recommendations are made for further research to improve current understandings of governance failures in the EU. Recommendations are also made for the improvement of policy implementation, including the rectification of scientific errors incorporated into policy, and the way in which policy rationale is communicated to policy actors.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3497k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Interviews, focus group discussions, questionnaire surveys, documents review, and non-participant observations were the primary techniques used in data collection. Data analysis involved both qualitative and quantitative methods employing a mixed methods approach. Findings reveal that achievement of the stated benefits of implementing irrigation reform cannot simply be guaranteed without serious and thoughtful consideration of other key factors such as spatial and temporal variations in water availability, existence of multiple and multi-sectoral users/uses across the river basin, legal and policy frameworks, the effects of extreme weather and climate events, social structure, demographics, and the capacity of local organizations taking over the management of the schemes. While irrigation management transfer (IMT) appears to improve household income, the dominance of agriculture as the main livelihood strategy counteracts possible environmental benefits of improved household economic status. Furthermore, there is a general deficit in the performance of the reform particularly with regards to meeting some key IMT objectives e.g. improving water delivery, ensuring environmental sustainability, reversing deterioration of infrastructure, and turning irrigation systems into financially self- sustaining entities. Key factors behind the apparent underperformance include lack of capacity of the Wovwe Water Users Association (WWUA), conflicting implementation of water rights between informal traditional irrigators and the WWUA, and effects of climate change.  Despite the inadequacies, the IMT still manages to meet some of its stated goals e.g. reductions in government expenditure, improved rural peopleâ€™s income, and bringing all land within the Wovwe Irrigation Scheme (WIS) under cultivation. However, the way government achieves expenditure reductions is counterproductive to the very sustainability of the irrigation system as it negatively affects critical irrigation services such as hydrological monitoring, planning, and technical advisory services.  For any successful IMT implementation, this thesis strongly recommends a coordinated approach in enforcing conventional and customary water rights in the same basin especially where both formal and informal irrigation are simultaneously being promoted. Such implementation should be based on a thorough assessment of the water resource which will support both IMT and informal irrigation and socio-cultural parameters; and should be preceded by the establishment of functional hydrological and environmental monitoring systems. Furthermore, governments should consider building the capacity of recipient user organizations before the schemes are transferred from the state control to user.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (24637k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The concept of LEG has been explored in the theoretical context of the underlying theories of local governance, environmental governance, multi-level governance, Europeanization and rules. The intensive processes of governance reforms in Bulgaria have been fuelled by democratization, globalization and European Union (EU) accession and membership with impacts on all governance levels, including local level. The Europeanization of rules and practices has posed new powers and responsibilities on Bulgarian municipalities in environmental field (notably in waste and wastewater management). Bulgarian municipalities have been in the focus of the research as local governance space and unit of analysis. The data for the dissertation has been collected from field research with three in-depth case studies (Teteven, Lukovit and Dobrich urban), from interviews at national level, and from document sources and direct observations. Case municipalities represent medium-sized and big municipalities both of urban and rural type. LEG has been explored through the lens of rules and rule-making processes at local level.  Mayor and municipal administration have been identified as central actors and rule-makers within the municipality’s realm. Other actors like local NGOs, businesses and even municipal councils have been found in far weaker position concerning capacity and interest in local environmental governance. The most sophisticated rules’ system has been developed for waste management whereas areas like soil and biodiversity protection and even climate change are missing or are at initial stage on local agenda. The patterns of rule-making and governance in general are dominated by leadership and personalities’ powers, closed rule-making system, traditionalism, local centralism (concentration of powers and resources at municipal administrations), weak civil society and still underdeveloped expert capacity. Rule enforcement is also rather weak and subjective.  The Europeanization has been driving force and symbol of new governance arrangements externalized in rules, new staff and large environmental investment funding. The national administration is keeping its central position in development, implementation of environmental policies, and in guiding, monitoring and sanctioning local administrations. The importance of local circumstances has been exemplified by local actors and their capacity and interests. In some cases local level is not the most suitable level for environmental governance – e.g. in biodiversity protection and climate change. Hierarchies have emerged as dominant governance structure that defines also the current mode of multi-level governance.

According to IPCC buildings provide large mitigation potential at low costs, especially in economies in transition and developing countries. The aim of the dissertation is to determine energy savings potential for space heating in public buildings in Hungary, one of the economies in transition. The dissertation also aims to assess risks of suboptimal retrofit applied at a large scale and to estimate the related “lock-in effect”. The potential is determined based on two types of modelling approaches: first, a well-established component-based approach where the potentials of individual more efficient building components are summed up through supply curve method; and second, a rather novel, performance-based approach. The risks and opportunities as well as the lock-in effect are examined in through scenario analysis, which is based on the performance-based model. The results of the comparison of the results of the two modelling approaches, first of its kind in time of writing, shows significant difference between the potential determined by component- and performance-based approach. This comparison also shows that the performance-based approach is a flexible modelling tool. The calculation of the potential in both approaches is based on average specific heating energy requirements for eight types of public buildings, based on a set of energy audits conducted in Hungarian municipal buildings. Scenario analysis implies that although the rate of retrofit is important in determining the total potential, it is the level of energy performance the buildings are retrofitted, which is detrimental to the size of the potential. The analysis shows that if the existing public building stock is retrofitted at an accelerated rate but only partially, the resulting potential will be only slightly higher than if buildings are retrofitted to the level of high-performance buildings at a natural rate of retrofit, requiring much higher investment. Moreover, gradual retrofit to passive house standard at natural rate of retrofit leaves more room for further renovation even after 2030 and thus the resulting energy savings in 2050 would be higher. Further, if passive energy standard is gradually applied to the whole building stock, several times higher energy savings can be reached than if the partial retrofit is applied to the same building stock. The difference between these two cases, the lock-in effect, accounts for about 44% of the 2030 baseline energy consumption. This amount will be locked-in for several next decades if suboptimal retrofit is supported on a large scale. Thus, in order to use the public funds most effectively, high-performance retrofit should be preferred to suboptimal retrofit at a large scale.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1931k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Biomass can supply 1 EJ per year (or 18% in the country’s energy balance). The major part of this is formed by agricultural residues and energy crops. Annually nearly 175 PJ can be derived from straw, which is currently not used elsewhere. At present the biofuels sector in UA is not institutionalised. Biomass supplies only 0.5% in UA’s energy balance. The development of bioenergy is believed to help the country combat its significant energy security problem, contribute to the revitalisation of its agriculture and bring a number of other economic, social and environmental benefits. The work highlights and defines key factors and organisational elements for the transformation of local agro-bioenergy systems in Western Europe (WE) (i. e. Sweden, Denmark and Spain) and UA, and structures them into five types of new agro-biomass frameworks for organisation and action (ABFs). ABFs are described, analysed and compared via in-case and cross-case study analysis of 23 initiatives on straw use for energy in listed countries with the application of a conceptual framework developed by the author. All ABFs share key components but differ markedly according to the local context and resources, the nature of goals, the number of actors, complexity and degree of formalisation. Three major pathways delineated in this work include: 1) ‘straw for local heating’; 2) ‘straw for district heating’; 3) ‘straw for combined heat and power’. A roadmap towards the expansion of Pathway 1 and establishment of Pathways 2 and 3 in UA is suggested and discussed. Pathway 2 is viewed as the most feasible for the country to undertake considering its currently exploited biomass resources and forecasted potentials. Recommendations for the target audience (i.e. policy makers, non-governmental actors, academia and researchers), who would like to move new bioenergy systems forward are suggested. Among other, a recommendation to construct a 5-10 MW demonstration straw-fired district heating plant is given. The outcomes of the study are transferable to various contexts on the condition that local specificities are taken into account. This work accounts for different sides in discussions over bioenergy sustainability, which took place in academic and public circles within the last few years. Major concerns around biofuels include food versus fuel debate, greenhouse gas neutrality of biofuel production and use, and overall environmental impacts of biofuels at different stages in their lifecycles. Energy production from residual agricultural biomass (i.e. straw), which is studied within the scope of this work, avoids most of the general concerns on biofuel sustainability, however, has its own specific challenges, which need to be understood and managed appropriately.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (3049k)'}"

This dissertation explores the process by which national water policies in countries with contrasting policy circumstances – England, Turkey and Kazakhstan – are influenced by the international IWRM discourse. It introduces the concept of policy translation to capture the travel of ideas and their modification at the national level; analyzes the intellectual history of IWRM, the international IWRM discourse, and the drivers in the process of policy influence. Interviews, multiple case study, desk research, participant and non-participant observations, discourse analysis, critical content analysis, conference participation and other methods were used in this research. Policy ideas may travel via individuals and international organizations – as in less formalized systems of Turkey and Kazakhstan, or via networks and consultancies – as observed in England. The travel of ideas and their modification at the national level is explained through policy translation, which, contrary to policy transfer, emphasises the non-linearity of the travel and (re)interpretation of ideas. Institutional and legitimacy factors are as important in policy translation as formal cost-benefit analysis. National politics is of crucial importance for policy translation in all three cases and largely predetermines the interpretation of IWRM and the extent to which international experience is used. The capacity of states to process and meaningfully use the IWRM ideas coming from an international level is essential in policy translation and is linked to the financial and human resources and the mechanism for policy deliberation at the national level. The global hegemony of IWRM is predetermined by the ability of IWRM to be translated to the national level through the three pillars of hegemony - discursive, material and organizational domination. Thus, global IWRM hegemony operates via the successful processes of policy translation in national policy systems.', 'Summary': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (8107k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

People are not equal in the distribution of environmental benefits and exposure to adverse environmental impacts. Social factors, like class and ethnic affiliation, play an important role. The dissertation is based on field research in 35 Roma settlements (five settlements in two in-depth case studies and 30 other places using Rapid Rural Appraisal). The aim of the field research was twofold. The first consideration was to assess the distribution of environmental benefits and harm and the subsequent impacts on village populations. Four main patterns of environmental injustice were identified: exposure to hazardous waste and chemicals, vulnerability to floods, limitations on access to potable water, and waste management practice). The second consideration was to determine and analyze the social processes that contribute to the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and harm. Competition and conflict in access to (and management of) natural resources between two groups of unequal social and political status (the ethnic group of Roma and their non-Roma neighbors) were then set forth as an explanatory framework. The main impact of the inequalities is the conceptualization of Roma village sections as “beyond the pale” spaces where environmentally controversial practices are (or may be) gradually concentrated.

The geographical dimension has two edges: the Maghreb countries of the Southern-Mediterranean region are focused upon from the developing country perspective, while a number of EU donor countries’ related policies are considered in order to suggest future directions for the international development cooperation policy of an emerging EU donor country, Hungary. This is all in harmony with the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the new European Neighbourhood Policy.  From the theoretical perspective, an analysis of 30 years of history of the formulation and reformulation process of the desertification concept has been carried out, reaching a conclusion that the present official UNCCD definition needs reconsideration and renegotiation to widen the scope of the UNCCD to include countries that experience desertification processes and drought with land areas that fall into other categories than arid, semi-arid, and dry-subhumid.  Although an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the examined countries (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia) together with an analysis of international development cooperation projects have confirmed that most of the examined implemented projects correspond to the individual countries’ needs with respect to combating desertification and climate change, one of the conclusions is that in some cases the “recipient country driven approach” is not present and should be strengthened. It is an important observation that it is not enough if sectoral donor projects are improved in specific areas, but it has to be accompanied by a reform and restructuring of these countries’ public administration system in order that they are able to absorb financial and technical assistance in an efficient way.  The dissertation is closed by a forward-looking statement for Hungary, as it is emphasised that the country should become an active participant in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership for its own national interests and for complying with international expectations.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1564k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Many scholars and managers now question the traditional top-down approach of excluding local participation and ignoring local interests in protected areas establishment and management. More participatory planning is believed to enhance local support for biodiversity conservation goals of protected areas. It is also believed that sustainable utilization of certain resources and/or protected area outreach programs will contribute to rural development, especially in underdeveloped countries, and decrease conflicts between local people and park authorities. However, efforts in different parts of the world to integrate objectives of biodiversity conservation and rural development have had mixed results. This research highlights some of the challenges to this process in the communal areas of South Africa. This research adopts a mixed methods approach utilizing questionnaires, interviews, the Pebble Distribution Method, and Threat Reduction Assessments. It empirically examines the nature of the relationship, including the perceptions and use of natural resources, between the Kruger National Park (KNP) and rural Tsonga communities located adjacent to its western border. Some of these communities are represented on the Hlanganani Forum, established in 1994 when South Africa became a new democracy. The historical background of these communities, which form part of the former Gazankulu homeland, is characterized by a general dissatisfaction with park authorities due to conflicts with wildlife and perceived loss of access to resources within the KNP. Although the focus here is on interactions between South Africa's KNP and its neighbouring rural communities, the findings have relevance and resonance beyond Africa as they raise key questions that can be considered in similar contexts.  Fundamentally, this thesis argues that KNPâ€™s success in merging goals of biodiversity conservation and socio-economic development is largely shaped by, and dependent upon, local perceptions of institutions responsible for resource use and access. Specifically for KNP, stronger and more forthright commitment and dedicated investment towards its neighbouring communities is needed. Moreover, to effectively integrate these objectives, KNP and protected areas in similar contexts must: i) involve a thorough understanding by all stakeholders of the ongoing needs and aspirations of relevant parties, including local perceptions of nature and its conservation; ii) be supported by strong institutions, and enabling legislation and policies; iii) meaningfully address immediate concerns including employment, damage-causing animals, and land claims; and iv) recognize and accept limitations to partnerships, including those concerning public safety and veterinary risks."", 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Within and in response to this turn, postcolonial and feminist theorists have debated the implications of Deleuze and Guattari’s own representations of various ‘others’ of the West, with particular attention to the concepts ‘nomad’ and ‘becoming-woman.’ This thesis combines feminist and postcolonial critique without relying on a call for better representation, as most critics have, and without invoking either the ‘purity’ of these Deleuzo-Guattarian concepts or their ontological reality, as have many thinkers who find their work useful. Rather, I close read invocations of the ‘Orient’ in A Thousand Plateaus to argue that Deleuze and Guattari’s appeals to mutability, excess and multiplicity as defying representation are indebted to an Orientalist imaginary that is structural rather than incidental to their conceptualization of what might be before, beyond and exterior to Western representational thought. Putting this reading in conversation with the work of Jasbir Puar (2007), I argue that it is in part these qualities of an Orientalized ‘exterior’ in Deleuzo-Guattarian philosophy that enable her analysis of contemporary ‘homonationalism’ to rethink ‘queerness’ not as an identity but as an ontological assemblage that emerges in the inevitable relationality between discursive figurations and the bodily register of affect. Thereby, this thesis augments current endeavors to represent ontological forces such as affect in theory with an argument that implicates anti-representational Deleuzo-Guattarian theory itself in a discursively modulated imaginary, thus opening up future work on how the anti-representational turn can be thought together with its representational legacies.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Since then, she has not only been crafting an empowered feminine identity based on alternative health practices and spiritual practices but also one that is professional and entrepreneurial. In this thesis I therefore tease out how Dolores engages in these processes of self-formation, and how these are tied to larger biopolitical structures of regular medicine, science, and neoliberal capitalism. Importantly, I look at how biopower produces an embodied feminine subjectivity that is premised on gendered notions of care, the body, health, nature, truth and authenticity. At the same time, this thesis is about the biopolitical character of alternative medicine and contemporary spirituality – two systems that intertwine in the context of ‘healing’ in western wellbeing culture. Indeed, it is through health that Dolores turns her lived experience into a narrative of her gendered self. Why is spiritual CAM so powerful for Dolores? It provides Dolores with the technologies to construct her self, her body and her activities as more authentic and essential and thus as more natural and true. In Foucaultian terms, this means that CAM attempts to present a counter-discourse to the hegemonic narratives that are constructed by medicine and science but that the same biopolitical logic applies. Ultimately, CAM intensifies the biopower that flows through it.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Through a critical discourse analysis of Russian ageing policy documents, textual materials and recordings of speeches from the annual conference on ageing Society for All Ages (Obshchestvo Dlya Vsekh Vozrastov), and articles from the newspaper Arguments and Facts (Argumenty i Fakty), I explore the ways in which the “successful ageing” paradigm has influenced the discussions on ageing in the Russian context. Drawing on critical gerontology’s perspective on “successful ageing” and queer theory’s critique of temporality, I deploy Linn Sandberg’s notion of “positive ageing assemblage” to trace the multiple articulations and voices which shape the image of the ageing subject (Sandberg 2015). This research exposes how these expectations for “successful ageing” reflect a heteronormative perception of later life as “time of inheritance” (Halberstam 2005). The perception of intergenerational connection based on the notion of generativity reinforces the normative understanding of familial relations and defines the validity of the ageing subject in reference to their “resourcefulness” for a youthful future. At the same time, such prioritization of youthfulness is being co-opted by actors advocating for the importance of transforming the current infrastructure to make it more inclusive. The other aspect of “successful ageing” paradigm is the consumerist logic which sees such “success” as a matter of lifestyle that can be maintained through individual’s “voluntary” reflexive participation in consumerist practices and ignores the social structural factors affecting this process (Katz 2013, Lury 1996). Thus, the ageing subject is invited to engage with the “successfully ageing” ideal, and express the “reflexive” self, through practices of “managing” health and longevity, appearance and embodiment, and (hetero)sexual practices. This “management” has to correspond with the conventional perceptions of femininity, masculinity, familial life, and neoliberal values. This thesis’ analysis indicates that the standards imposed by such logic constrain the discussion of ageing futures, excluding the actual living trajectories which do not comply with the norm.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This analysis often calls for the protection of romantic love that is then understood as having a transcendental dimension, much in line with the theological discourse. At the same time, leftist discourse excludes love – especially love understood as transcendence – from the conceptualization of community and politics. By analyzing Badiou’s ideas of love, politics and truth – in relation to some other leftist thinkers – I argue that there is a political stake in the leftist discourse that generates this gesture of eliminating both affective and transcendental dimension from the sphere of politics. This is done in order to preserve the ultimate truth of the communist future, the truth Marxist discourse projects from its very beginnings, and that would be contaminated by allowing for the affective dimension to play role in it. By engaging with the theory of Melanie Klein and the way Esteban Muñoz uses it – together with the philosophy of Ernest Bloch – in an attempt to generate a particular political philosophy, I am suggesting that both the understanding of the community and the imagining of political future would benefit from acknowledging the affective dimension and the epistemic transcendence, i.e. the acknowledgment that there is no certain truth about the future.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Therefore, it is an analysis of how, in contemporary Hungarian politics, the conception of the nation is gendered, and how reproduction is conceptualised within the nation; seeking an answer to the question, how exactly does gender figure in Orbán’s speeches? This is achieved through an analysis of Viktor Orbán’s political speeches and radio interviews made between 2015–2018, using the method of critical discourse analysis as outlined by Fairclough (2003). Additionally, since there has not been an adequate study of how contemporary anti-genderism draws on earlier discourses on reproduction, the analysis is then put into the context of the historical development of Hungarian family policies and the surrounding discourses of reproduction, demography, and the nation, from the state socialist welfare system of the 1960s to Fidesz-KDNP’s family policies in the 2010s. The findings of the research are the following: in this time period, Orbán almost exclusively talks about gender when he talks about the family; which is constructed as fundamental for the nation through its assumed role in reproduction. The nation itself is represented in a highly militarised way, as a unified actor in social processes, which are constructed as zero-sum conflicts. Demography plays a central role in winning or losing; therefore, childrearing is constructed as a tool to “make history.” These representations are found to resemble longstanding nationalist discourses which conceptualise the nation’s survival as dependent on proper reproduction, and thus on heteropatriarchal and reproductive families, and the subordination of women’s various positions in society (e.g. women as citizens) to their reproductive capacity in the nation.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Considering the ways through which the humanoid becomes sexualized and racialized, I will argue that Sophia enfolds the potentiality of subversion, that is of interest for feminist epistemology. In the theoretical framework of the first chapter, I will provide the reader with a genealogy of the category of human by focusing on the canonical patriarchal understanding of the rational man in Western philosophy, while also addressing the category of human species, so as to illustrate how these approaches formulated research in Artificial Intelligence. In the second chapter, I will provide a close reading analysis of Michel Foucault and Brian Massumi’s scholarship that bridges biopower and capitalism to the affect and the body’s materiality. Based on this, I will read the trope of emotionality used in Sophia’s case in relation to the modulation of affect in late capitalism. This way, I intend to illustrate how Sophia is imbedded in a much more nuanced web of relations of power, one that redefines the boundaries between who is included in the category of the human species and who is not. In the third chapter, by employing Michel Foucault’s analysis on biopower while also engaging with Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis I will draw attention to the discursive traces that construct Sophia’s identity in accordance to the biopolitical technologies of race and sexuality. Finally, in last chapter, drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s analysis on the abstract machine of faciality and Judith Butler’s approach on drag I will reflect on the constructiveness of the boundaries between the human and the non-human, to argue that Sophia is not just a product of her time but also a point of disruption that might unravel what Deleuze and Guattari call, the inhuman in the human.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Through these three categories of identification I explore the construction of specific forms of gendered racism that women from Latin America are subjected to.

Finally, I analyze women’s re-appropriation of the stigma that marginalized migrant-populated suburbs face in order to articulate a coalitional identity among other people of color.

I engage with shifting boundaries between academic and creative writing in order to transgress the borders of poetic and scholarly. Through my project I aim to reveal how identity is a battleground for articulating both exclusion and resistance. Thus, I argue that mestiza (hybrid) identity provides a powerful conceptual framework to understand how racialized women reclaim spaces and re-signify their existence.

I consider a subject as a mold for carving out individual units from the social matter, with shame and the sense of dignity as main framing elements. These elements prevent a subject from dissolution in the passionate attachment to others, and an autonomous subject is a basis of the democratic society. BDSM plays, through temporary and consensual dismantle of this structure, allow uninterrupted pleasure of the merger with the Other.

During its relatively brief tenure Willowbrook was wracked with scandals related to endemic mistreatment and neglect of its residents.

In short: an inmate at Willowbrook State School could be the subject of almost all forms of ableist violence within the thirty-six years of operation. In this project I examine the legacy of Willowbrook as a means to approach the larger construction of violence against disabled people. How can Willowbrook be mourned and what are the feminist possibilities of mourning Willowbrook? My research utilizes documentaries and memoirs about Willowbrook—how they construct Willowbrook, Willowbrook’s former residents, and the aftermath of Willowbrook. For this analysis I utilize the hauntological method, looking for contradictions and absences in my source material—I am looking for ghosts. I suggest in this work that the ghost may have a feminist function in considering our responses to violence against disabled people. There must be a method of mourning that takes the fractured structure of life and death for disabled people as its core precept.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, studies on relationships between cis and trans persons have argued that trans women are critical of trans-attracted cis men. This comes from the accusation that many cisgender men fetishize transgender women. Trans-fetishization is used in this study as the fetishizing of trans women by cis men who overvalue the trans women’s transness. The exploration of trans-fetishization is done in context of committed relationships between cis men and trans women, and highlights the perspectives of cis men in the relationships. Through an analysis of the accounts shared by Filipino men in a voiced online interview, the author analyzes how fetishism may be challenged or explored in (1) the men’s motivations for entering a committed relationship, (2) their concept of an ideal woman, (3) the strategies they employ to maintain high-level of commitment, (4) and their compliance or resistance to hegemonic masculinity. The analysis reveals that men commit to relationships based on the reasons, sometimes overlapping, of material benefits, need for companionship, and the desire to move on from the dating phase by formalizing the relationship. Transness has not been a major factor and therefore, trans-fetishization cannot be accused in this context. Analysis also reveals that men were not attracted to their trans partners because of their transness, instead, their trans partners embody physical and non-physical traits similar to the men’s standard for an “ideal woman.” Using the investment model (Rusbult and Buunk 1993), the level of commitment of the relationships was assessed. It shows that there is a high level of commitment among the men based on satisfaction level, lack of availability of quality alternatives, and investment of resources. Commitment in the relationships are also maintained by heteronormativity and transnormativity. Adherence to these normativities provides the author basis to assert that transness is not fetishized as an overvalued object of sexual desire. In the context of heteronormativity and cisnormativity, what may be argued as the fetish object is the adherence of the trans partners to the feminine norms. Finally, analysis shows that men, in diverse ways, comply with and resist hegemonic masculinity (Connell 1987, reformulated 2005) and thus undermines the accusation of trans-fetishization. At the most, the transness of their partners may only be negotiated against hegemonic masculinity. Future endeavors in this scope include an investigation of relationships between partners of different nationalities, as well as an exploration of non-monogamous and/or non-heterosexual cis-trans relationships.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

While survivors were asked to tell their memories within the scopes of oral history project, they were also given an option to draw a simple map of their villages or towns. Later on those imagined and memory-based maps were compared to the updated maps of those cities and this served as a basis of further analysis for the project participants. Upon seeing the city mapped according to the affective experiences of women, it was the first time that I realized how powerful this form of layered, spatialized geographical tool can be if it is made ‘readable’ for many kinds of audiences. Following the completion of that project, I began to explore similar mapping projects worldwide in order to understand the methods and common tendencies within this developing area within the digital humanities. The idea of ‘mapping’ gendered exclusions in Yerevan came about as the result of a simple need to find a method of layering and pinning down the places where I have encountered aggressive or threatening gaze or verbal harassment. Based on the preliminary research in the field, I realized that map is the most efficient and accessible way for users to visualize and speak up about the issue. For that reason, my project consists of two parts: the map with women’s visualized stories of harassment in Yerevan and the theoretical and methodological part of the work that intends to set a larger frame to understand the topography of violence in public spaces. The theoretical frame of the thesis sets to analyze the dynamics between the traditional education (promoted by mothers) and the spatial projections of that education on the city landscape. The affective interaction between the bodies and the spaces sets a theoretical frame in order to understand the spatial experiences of city-dweller women and the images of places for them shaped through those experiences. Lastly, as initially designed, this project is intended to be an open-access platform and participatory mapping project.

The research is a case study of the peer counselling group of one of Hungary’s largest university, ELTE (Eötvös Loránd University). Based on ten in-depth individual interviews with peer advisors – who are students themselves training to be psychotherapists – the thesis examines how neoliberal reasoning, mediated through post-feminist though and mainstream psychology, appears in the counsellors’ beliefs about mental health, self-management and care work. The research aimed to provide an example of how individual solutions are offered for larger scale structural problems, for instance by locating the source of anxiety in personal deficiency. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is increasing worldwide as well as in Hungary, and the majority of those affected are women. This thesis argues that this phenomenon is embedded in various structural developments caused by a neoliberal governance. The privatization of mental health services, as part of a larger crises of care work, is resulting in the expansion of self-help. Competitiveness and entrepreneurial logic are promoted for women through gender mainstreaming and what can be referred to as “neoliberal feminism”, while higher education is also a site of these developments, increasing perfectionism and competition, and favoring disciplines based solely on their worth on the market. The peer advisors themselves internalized and mediated these expectations and neoliberal technologies of the self for their clients, however they also had their criticisms of increasingly atomized views on mental health. They recognized structural, economic problems when discussing their peers’ anxiety, nevertheless, they mainly ignored gender as a factor in mental health. I labeled their reasoning a “pessimist” post-feminism, that might be specific to Hungary. While they believed women have already achieved emancipation in their professional lives, they identified the prescriptive nature of gender in the case of men, hindering their possibilities of asking for help. Even thought, they conceptualized their methods as gender blind, I argue that women worked as a default category for the advisors, who were mostly women themselves. In connection to this, a gendered division of labor emerged through their work as they provided free mental health services for engineering students, who were predominantly men. Based on these results future research could further pursue the specifics of the applicability of post-feminism in a post-socialist, Hungarian context. Gender based horizontal segregation in higher education seems to play a significant role in students’ mental health and the nature of their anxieties. Special attention should be paid for institutional factors behind engineering students increased levels of anxiety. At the same time the mental health of care workers – such as future psychotherapists – is especially important, as they are preparing for the financial and mental burdens of their work, possibly already during their university years.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

With the merger of FATA in 2018 with the neighboring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa despite the ongoing IDP crisis and a rising social movement considered to be anti-state, the voices of women are still lost in the chaos. In order to critically engage with the absence of women from repatriation policies and future political outcomes, I will draw upon Giorgio Agamben’s idea of “State of Exception,” to contextualize FATA’s politico-social status, and his work Homo Sacer, to demonstrate how the double exclusion of women from public spaces and decision-making forums is validated by state policies and archaic customs which in turn makes them more vulnerable as IDPs.

By utilizing theories of nationalism, gender, and the state, this thesis seeks to examine the complexities of the postwar reality for survivors of wartime sexual violence in Kosovo and the impacts of gendered nationalism on state-level policy and recognition for survivors. Two dominant narratives have been established: that of the European aspirational ideal and of the Albanian ethno-national invocation of masculine war heroes and freedom fighters. Sexual violence – and victimhood in general – did not fit into these state narratives, further impacting policy priorities. In parallel with dominant state narratives, the taken for granted androcentrism of the state apparatus continues to impact recognition of survivors of wartime sexual violence. I analyze the 2014 Amendment to the Law on Civilian Victims of War in light of the current application process for state-level benefits for survivors, and argue that the Amendment does well to support some survivors, while still maintaining state narratives of singular, ethnic priorities.

I am interested in seeing the roles of the nonhuman for the ontological articulation for queer of colour people. The chapter ontological anxiety gives an account of my own bodily experiences and serves as the affective mediation in my reading of Hang’s photos. I describe a XXX feeling and suggest to read it as a way of “speaking” based on the materiality of Hang’s photos. I recognise this feeling viscerally. The XXX feeling is not read through an individualised bodily account and is intended to follow Muñoz’s project of affective mappings.

I am interested in seeing the roles of nonhuman in disrupting racialized/racializing gazes of Chinese queer bodies.

The naturalization and diffused nature of settler colonialism in North America meant that many of the white settler allies came to the encampments with a lack of understanding of how the struggle against DAPL is situated within centuries of anticolonial resistances against settler colonialism.

On the one hand, I explore the ways the Standing Rock movement creates alternative politics, solidarities, and communities rooted in Indigenous land-based knowledges through its resistance against the ongoing forms of settler colonial expropriation and industrial extraction. On the other hand, I examine how the logics of white settler colonialism were reproduced and interrupted in the intimate geographies of solidarity at the Standing Rock encampments. Through an anticolonial feminist activist ethnography consisting of twenty-one in-depth, semi-structured interviews with individuals who participated in the encampments, this thesis contributes to anticolonial scholarship on resistance and solidarities by unpacking the multivocalties in the grassroots Standing Rock movement, and exploring the tensions and opportunities they create, in order to interrogate white settler coloniality as it intersects with processes of allyship. Ultimately, I demonstrate how solidarities between white settlers, people of color, and Indigenous peoples in the Standing Rock movement produce ruptures in the settler colonial social order, and reimagine settler decolonization by generating possibilities for decolonial subjectivities, relationships, and futurities.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

My analysis is based on 20 semi-structured interviews and a literature review drawing from sexological, psychoanalytic, gender studies, and ethnographic fields, which chronicles the historical and contemporary social construction of BDSM.

I show that affective belonging is built in both locations through solidarity and educational events, which are more frequent in London than in Budapest. Perhaps in part due to differing educational resources, knowledge of gender varies greatly between my fieldwork sites, expressed with more fluency and reflexivity in London through notions of performativity and in a more parochial manner in Budapest through temporal references to the 1800s.

While half of the women in my study did cite money as an important motivator, more significantly almost all interviewees mentioned work enjoyment and the opportunity to engage with peer company as a significant benefit of their employment. This thesis argues that the reason for this is that the Hungarian social policy system provides a reasonable income-replacement for women who were previously employed, enabling a significant number of interviewees to choose employment because of its various positive effects on their own well-being. Some women, who did not experience financial pressures to work, described how earning a salary also contributed towards their well-being by enhancing their self-esteem. Although interviewees emphasized their own needs, they still positioned their children’s well-being as very important, while intricately linking it to their own needs as well. Most women conceptualized their children’s needs as remarkably similar to their own, stressing the benefits of peer company and mental stimulation provided by an institutional childcare setting. Women in this study rejected the psychological attachment theory discourses which posit full-time maternal care as central to children`s well-being. While they maintained the importance of a close mother-and-child bond, they dismissed the notion that this could only be achieved if they were continuously available to their child. Rather, some women conceptualized employment as helping them be better mothers through quality time together.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I aim to find out to what ways and extent LGBT community can be perceived homonormative. Based on discourse analysis, which implies a production of power-knowledge through everyday practices and narratives, I conducted interviews, focusing on a core of LGBT activists. I complemented interviews with a participant observation method, conducted during two major LGBT events. I explored whether discourses and representations of three forms of relationships -- coupledom, multiple partner relationships, and singledom -- are similar or how are they different; what kind of power strategies are used for sustaining homonormativity within the community. My findings reveal different power strategies dealing with each form of social arrangements, used to fortify normativity. I distinguished most common and frequent associations in responses of my interviewees -- temporality and ethics. Thus, planned character or longevity, as well as the ecology of treatment or self-knowledge enable to explore discoursive differences for three examined forms. The most conservative form of partnering coupledom was established as a reference point. Multiple partner relationships are constructed through a comparison to coupledom and have clearly disadvantageous connotations in terms of temporality, ethics, and representation. Singledom appears as the most complicated practice and manifests a unique strategy -- a concealment of itself as a stand-alone practice. A discourse of singledom as a temporary state overshadows its subversive character. Representation of three formats of social arrangements, observed during two Queer Festival events and expressed by my informants, contributes into the discussion about the extent to which the Ukrainian LGBT group appear homonormative to a certain extent.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Restricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

These ideas are rehearsed against the theoretical backdrop of Leo Bersani’s and Lee Edelman’s antirelational queer theory, José Estaban Muñoz’s work on queer potentiality, relationality and hope as articulated in Cruising Utopia in opposition to antiutopian antirelationality, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s affective turn (in particular her theorizing on shame and her concept of paranoid and reparative reading). The analyses in the first two chapters gesture toward a displacement of antirelational queer theory’s overinvestment in the radicality of strategically embracing cultural fantasies of male homosexuality as psychic negativity or erotic self-annihiliation. In contrast to these tropes, a vision of queer relationality grounded in the relational dynamics of shame is forwarded, drawing on Sedgwick’s work on shame inspired by Silvan Tomkins’s affect theory. The shy queer man thus comes to figure as a counterpoint to the death-driven queer subject enraptured by jouissance. The third chapter, in turn, moves from such a contrastive “anti-antirelational” engagement to a closer exploration of Tomkins’s theory of shame, combining it with phenomenological film theory and Sara Ahmed’s work on queer phenomenology, arguing that the short film’s climactic moment allows us to think shame as utopian potentiality as conceived by Muñoz. Finally, the conclusion suggests a conception of shame as reparative affect in contrast to routinized habits of thought in paranoid antirelational queer theory.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The present thesis articulates the gendered experiences of loss and suffering experienced by these women. Through my work, I trace the historicity of enforced disappearances as a phenomenon, elaborating on how these are a tool to both crush dissent, and to create a state of paranoia and insecurity in Kashmir; strengthening Indiaâ€™s military occupation. In doing so, I examine the resilient nature of the forms of resistance present in Kashmir, and I present how women in Indian occupied Kashmir have adopted various nonconventional and unique resistance methods to assert their agency against militarized occupation. The use of a postcolonial theoretical framework allows me to situate my research within the existing literature on the topic and to investigate my positionality as a Kashmiri woman and a researcher. Through the use of semi-structured oral histories as a methodology, I further highlight the tradition of preserving and relaying oral histories in Kashmir and enunciate the importance of unearthing the voices of the ignored, the marginalized, and the oppressed. Through the use of oral histories, I also assert the importance of recorded oral testimonies in strengthening a counter-narrative to the state-imposed hegemonic narrative of the fate of the disappeared person in Indian occupied Kashmir. Finally, I exemplify how the lives of the women related to the victims of enforced disappearances in Indian occupied Kashmir have become intertwined through strong and endurable relationships based on their collective suffering and shared the pain. Further, I argue that the identities of these women are politically injured because of the expectations that the Kashmiri conservative society levies on them. Finally, I examine the intricate relationship between memories and dreams, and how these become a strong tool of resistance against the (military) occupation in Indian occupied Kashmir. While this thesis is a fragment of a vast area of the knowledge on the subject that remains unexplored and that must be dealt with in more detail, my main objective is to highlight the agency of the women fighting against enforced disappearances in Indian occupied Kashmir.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The sacrificial structure permits the killing of animals yet obscures the existence of this specific type of violence that objectifies the Other. This functioning of Western societies instigates an ontological division between human/animal and positions the male meat-eater individual as the only full subject possible. I propose an intervention on this system by deconstructing Tupinamba cannibal rituals through a close reading of philosophical and anthropological literature as well as a decolonial and feminist remaking of concepts. By considering and theorizing biological insights, the cannibal feminist ethics proposes the reconceptualization of act(s) of eating as productive, collective and relational interactions between Self/Other. The process of subjectivation happens when the Self incorporates the perspective of the Other through the act of eating, according to radical imaginations around Amerindian perspectivism and the cosmologies behind Tupinamba cannibalism. In my thesis, the cannibal acts of eating are deconstructed as human sacrifices and their innovative politics of enmity are highlighted as a means of analyzing the deployment of violence. The kinship which takes place between killer/enemy in Tupinamba cannibalistic rituals and the mourning of the latter can be conceptualized as a recognition of the violence. Therefore, violence becomes a stride toward the final goal of relationality attained through the cannibal act of eating. In this way, the cannibal and their rituals break the colonial imagination around them and appear as innovative sites for rethinking subjectivity, interactions between Self/Other and the hierarchies of human/non-human.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This thesis wonders about the challenges of having legal abortion and looks for answers in feminist theories of the nation-state and decolonial perspectives. Through feminist Critical Discourse Analysis, this study specifically examines the speeches given by the lawmakers in the 2018 abortion parliamentary debates to unravel the extent in which gendered notions of nation and the state went under resignification, sustaining and contesting hegemonic discourses. I argue here that both positions, supporting and rejecting the Bill, have reinforced and challenged hegemonic gendered depictions of the nation with variations in the extent and content of this resignification. The anti-Bill position has (re)produced heteronormative hegemonic visions of the nation-state while also has disputed Argentinian national authenticity as a reflection of the west. Conversely, the position supporting the Bill, has contested hegemonic heteronormative visions of gender relations and national imaginaries but has left unproblematized traditional colonial Argentinian logics of power. By examining legal abortion with these lenses, this thesis improves the understanding of the mutual affection between matters of sexuality, (non) reproduction, nation, and the state. It also problematizes longstanding expectations that conservatives groups would only reproduce hegemonic national imaginaries, and proves that they have also challenged these imaginaries. Moreover, this study examines feminist demands of legal abortion towards patriarchal and colonial institutions such as the law and the state, showing that, in this process, a new type of feminist? /progressive nationalism have been emerging in Argentina. National configurations have been relevant for both positions, and, as revealed here, they will continue to be significant in the following decades.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This thesis analyses three key pillars of Crawfurd’s activism: the campaign for women’s suffrage, the era of Red Clydeside in Glasgow, and communist internationalism. The over-compartmentalisation of women’s activism in British historiography has led to the omission of vital connections between actors, movements and political ideas. This thesis thus seeks to surpass the confines of methodological nationalism by illustrating various instances of transnational connections and organising that were present locally and nationally. By focusing on Crawfurd’s lived experience of communist internationalism, I offer an analysis of her politics that challenges the dominance of political history writing; asserting the importance on the personal and the everyday, as opposed to so-called high politics. Through analysing local movements, I also illustrate instances of resistance and divergence that have been widely overlooked in the writing of national history. Ultimately, this thesis posits that Helen Crawfurd has been widely neglected by historiography because of her gender, locality and her commitment to communist internationalism.

It addresses the difference between men’s and women’s experience within the scheme and the reasons why public work is attractive to women in a specific structural, relational and circumstantial context. The study is based on interviews I have conducted with 15 public workers and three managers in two different cities, one in Pest county and another one in Komárom-Esztergom county. The thesis provides a gender analysis of public work and workfare and engages with the debate regarding work-care decisions. It also demonstrates how the prevalence of the ideal worker norm channels women into a specific type of employment. I argue that female public work participants use their job as a strategic tool to achieve work-life balance in a time when the labor market is characterized by rigid work arrangements and long working hours. However, this strategy allows women to continue to bear the double burden of paid and unpaid work instead of improving the conditions within the labor market for both men and women. With the increased ratio of women in public work, it becomes a new type of pink-collar employment that tolerates women’s domestic responsibilities. Despite the precarity that surrounds the job, I argue that women are able to derive emotional, social and financial gains from it. Paid work allows women to feel competent and appreciated which stands in contrast with the way domestic work is perceived.

Although scholars have long studied the impact of family policy incentives on demographic outcomes, little attention has been paid to individuals’ actual awareness of these policies or to the role of men and women as active agents in resisting state benefits. Through 26 qualitative interviews, this study compares individuals’ responses to pronatalism in Hungary, a country with an established family policy infrastructure, and the United States, a country with a history of limited government family welfare. In Hungary, individuals were widely knowledgeable about how they could benefit from having larger families, but constructed instinctual narratives about parenthood or considered migration to resist the government’s conspicuous pronatalism. In the United States, female respondents had much greater policy knowledge and anxiety about parenthood than male respondents. To cope with their anxiety, American female respondents relied on individualized strategies and redefined their expectations for equal partnership. American male respondents prematurely resorted to traditional gendered divisions of labor. While all other respondents maintained that their fertility intentions could not be altered, American female respondents expressed shifting financial preferences for children, a strategy that may allow these women to reclaim agency in the face of limited support. Altogether, this research reveals that policymakers can no longer ignore subjects’ active role in determining the relative success of different fertility incentives.

While scholars of cultural theory have written extensively on gender and abortion politics in relation to Ireland, none have considered how national narratives of fear and shame in the media established and proliferated medical abortion use as a site for the reproduction of idealized gendered and national identity. Similarly, no research has of yet considered the significance of the medical abortion phenomenon as a transformative moment in the history of Irish abortion politics. Tracing the developments of illegal medical abortion use in Ireland through media reports on the topic from 1985 – 2015, I use affect theory and feminist theories of nationalism to close read texts on the subject in the years preceding news of its increasing illegal use in Ireland and thereafter until 2015. Tracing the work that emotion performs in this intimate public allows for the scrutiny of prevailing constructions of gender and iterations of national belonging which affirm the fantasies of the (re)productive nation. Attending to these processes, particularly as they relate to the (re)production of national norms, enables the deconstruction of cultural imperatives in place on gender and national identity in Ireland. Furthermore, my analysis not only shows the extent to which abortion politics have shifted in Ireland in relation to the medical abortion phenomenon, but also provide important indications and potential warnings for how such politics might continue to unfold, even with the repeal of the Eighth amendment.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I argue that f/f/f is a feminist invention in historical terms, understanding that the meaning creation has been produced through the development of specialized literature and by the process of naming a practice that did not have a previous name. The concept of this form of murder as a social phenomenon had to become apparent for it to appear in history, and it has done so by means and through a feminist interest to define it. F/f/f is thus a feminist invention. In the research I study the three periods of temporality inscribed inside the historicity of the concept. These temporal spaces are that of immediacy (the multiple definitions of f/f/f from 1992 onwards), the broader period of time where the event is encompassed (1970s radical feminism), and the third space is that of the long-term process (the history of the International Womenâ€™s Movement). The goal of this study is to bring the discipline of history in conversation with f/f/f literature and to fill the gap in this literature regarding the particular historical processes embedded in the creation of feminist sociopolitical concepts.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Building on the working assumption that everyday gendered practices and norms are not imposed exclusively from above but are also shaped by the active participation and choices of individuals and communities, this thesis offers a reparative reading of motherhood, creating space to carefully consider its meaning and value among the women interviewed. It also considers the familial and social mechanisms that make up the institution of motherhood as experienced by these women in Tyumen, depicting multi-layered pressures to become mothers as well as a social precarity regarding acceptable expressions of motherhood. Drawing on stories of navigating reproductive, obstetric, and pediatric health care services in Tyumen, it also considers the impact of a long history of pro-natalist policies and ideologies in Russia and the Soviet Union, and the influence this has on the lives and decision making of these women. The project ultimately highlights how high levels of expertise, navigational capital, and mutual support among the women I interviewed allowed them to be resilient in the face of institutional adversity and to negotiate for improved gender dynamics within their families.

Current trends of the historiography of the body tend to consider the body as constituted by human culture or as determined by biological and natural structures, giving to each perspective different temporalities and chronological frames. Through a genealogical exercise focused in narratives from the sixteenth century (Bartolomé De Las Casas and Juan Ginés Sepúlveda) and the nineteenth century (Daniel Wilson), I argue that each of these perspectives is anchored in an iterative citationality of a colonial/modern understanding of the temporality of the body with two stages defined by colonial classifications: In one, the materiality of the human body is porous to external forces that bring it closer to the body of the animal and make its temporality much slower. In the other one, Man exceeds this animal materiality and is porous to his autonomous internal forces bringing a progression towards his full humanity. This shows that rethinking the historicity of the body beyond the bodies of Man requires recognizing that anthropocentric differentiations are sustained by colonial classifications in the current modern/colonial system, which invites to look at the posthuman through decolonial eyes, as well as opening decolonial thought to the innovative conceptualizations of the feminist posthumanities. To develop this, I cross-fertilize the thought of Elizabeth Grosz and Sylvia Wynter, with the purpose of searching theoretical paths that unsettle this prefiguration of modern/colonial bodies. First, their thought proposes a dynamic and undetermined relation between biology and culture and matter and meaning. Second, they open the temporality of history to the future and the virtual, which challenges the narrative of progress towards Man through accumulation. Furthermore, for them history is not about the reproduction of the past, but about opening spaces for remembering different embodied futures.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This narrative serves as an anchor as well as a driving force for the sector – where employees, especially women, are urged to exercise altruism to perform work that is perceived to be ‘natural’ to their gender – like exercising empathy, emotion management, and care work in shelter homes. As NGOisation in India coincided with the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the early 1990s, this phenomenon witnessed an increased participation of women in the Indian labour market. Additionally, NGOisation introduced the focus on ‘empowerment of women’ within the lexicon of development work. During this period, a significant number of women joined NGOs because philanthropic work was perceived as an extension of their traditional gender roles of care-work which limited the resistance from families. Though NGO work promised to deliver economic empowerment to beneficiaries from low income households, participation in NGO work proved empowering for women employees too as it significantly impacted their social identity and class positionings.  Here, I argue that, instead of challenging the traditional gender roles of work which encouraged the participation of women in the 1990s, today, NGOs in India continue to reproduce them by not acknowledging and under-compensating the emotional labour performed by women at work. I also argue that NGOs create employment opportunities for women with no formal trainings in social work, which harbours gratitude that invisibly binds women to these organisations. However, the opportunity to form strong social identities which are celebrated by their communities acts as an incentive for the women to continue working in the NGOs.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Scholars in the field of migration studies, international NGOs and intergovernmental human rights based organizations are critical of the European Union’s (EU) push back approach towards irregular migrants and call for the EU to be held accountable for human rights abuses occurring in transit zones along this route. This thesis is situated at the crossroads of these debates and examines modes of governmentality employed by the EU to regulate the mobility of irregular migrant women along the Nigeria-Libya-Italy migratory route, to restrict their arrival in receiving countries. Using findings gathered from fieldwork in Nigeria, I argue in this thesis that by constructing irregular migration as a phenomenon that poses a threat to the migrant subject, the EU adopts measures designed for facilitating tighter border controls and regulation of irregular migration. The EU’s interventions are constructed under a humanitarian rubric, through the medium of the anti-trafficking discourse and the work of the International Organization for Migration in Libya. Nevertheless, the humanitarian nature of the EU’s intervention casts a shadow on the role of the EU in the detention, dehumanization and abuse of human rights of irregular migrants in Libya.

The EU-Turkey deal, signed the following year, provided the framework to contain illegal entry into the EU and closed all (land and sea) routes of entry into the EU from Turkey. The research for this study was conducted from April-June in the year 2018. The narrow stretch of the Aegean Sea lying in between Izmir (Turkey) and the north shore of Lesvos still remained active during the time-span of this study. Routinely patrolled by the Hellenic Coast Guard, Frontex vessels, and sometimes by NATO warships, created a border security regime which produced migrant illegality. Once on the shore, they were transported to the refugee camp of Moria within a few hours. Moria, colloquially referred to as ‘hell on earth’, served as another site of body-politics, reducing their bodies to bareness. Through NGO spaces in Mytilene, these refugees and migrants were able to access a platform to create and recreate their temporal realities. This thesis traces the migration trajectory of the refugees and migrants through the border security regime, production of bare lives within the refugee camp, and the negotiation and navigation of temporal experiences. Through the lens of scaling, it illustrates the ways in which borders are being re-mapped, asymmetrical relations among bare lives produced, and the relationships between multiple temporal realities embodied. The material collected from the field was through the method of participation observation, in the capacity of a trainee at an NGO called Lighthouse Relief, and by conducting many semi-structured interviews of full-time NGO workers and trainees.

Taking a Foucauldian biopolitical framework, I first conceptualize how the Dutch self-perception as a white nation—an imagined genetic community—informs a biopolitical discourse of social belonging based on origin. Based on previous scholarship, I then show how a discourse of neoliberal colour-blindness comes to facilitate the dynamics of this biopolitical discourse of social belonging, deploying mechanisms of assimilation and roots-essentialism. I subsequently apply this conceptual analysis to contemporary Dutch adoptee politics to show how certain activist aims and strategies tie into these normalizing mechanisms of assimilation and roots-essentialism. Then, I turn to the work of David Eng, to demonstrate how his concept of queer diaspora provides an answer to queer liberalism, which is very similar to neoliberal colour-blindness. I take up the psychoanalytical underpinnings of queer diaspora, most notably the concept of racial melancholia, to re-interpret contemporary Dutch adoptee politics. Subsequently, I re-interpret the concept of racial melancholia itself by considering the common conflation of race and ethnicity. I show that such a re-interpretation suggests a strategy that entails building communities to bridge the gap between adoptees of colour and non-adopted people of colour. Finally, I turn to the work of José Esteban Muñoz to show how John McLeod’s concept of adoptive being can be read as a strategy of disidentification, not least because disidentification and adoptive being build on racial melancholia in a similar fashion. I conclude by formulating several brief thoughts on how disidentification constitutes a promising strategy for an adoptee politics that aims to question the racial norms of neoliberal multiculturalism and colour-blindness.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

It explores the political work of the first woman in a Norwegian government, Kirsten Hansteen (1903–1974), who, despite her pioneering role, is all but absent from Norwegian historiography. Based on archival research and feminist content analysis, the thesis uncovers the history of the left-feminist movement in Norway as well as Hansteen’s political activities in the years 1945–1949, during which she was a representative in the Norwegian Government and the Parliament for the Communist Party of Norway. The thesis’s main question is: Which role did Kirsten Hansteen play in the post-World War II Norwegian left-feminist movement? Through writing a partial political biography about Hansteen, this thesis explores how the World War II-context led to a left-feminism in Norway that perceived social inequality, gender inequality and fascism as intertwined. The larger women’s movement in Norway was characterised by a strong spirit of cooperation coming out of the war, which gradually crumbled as Cold War anti-communism increased, and the initially influential left-feminist movement became the target of hostility. This thesis shows how the anti-war position of left-feminists implicated them in the debate about Norway’s accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949, shedding light on the Norwegian women’s movement as a Cold War arena. It further illustrates the ways in which processes of anti-communism and misogyny impacted Hansteen’s political work and the organisations she was involved in, shaping the Norwegian political landscape and women’s movement with long term effects. Such conflicts and discourses are a part of broader historical processes which have also affected how left-feminist women such as Hansteen have been remembered. This thesis argues that Hansteen personified the Norwegian left-feminist movement, and because she did not perceive women’s oppression as a gender-only issue, Hansteen has been neglected in the historiography of Norwegian women’s movements and feminisms.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I use glitter as the main matter and figure to conduct this research, structuring my analysis through two axes: the politics of aesthetics and the politics of pollution. Reflecting on the exchange value of shimmery objects and the use of glitter in queer politics of visibility, I critically engage with the visual political economy that is offered by glitter. Regarding aesthetics, I analyze the consumption of glitter by the queer community, having in mind the motivations and meanings that are built around it. First, I address the question of how glitter is taken as a metaphor for visibility within the queer community. Then, I acknowledge the ways this queer use of glitter is criticized from environmental perspectives. Drawing on this juxtaposition of queer and environmental politics, I propose a new perspective, what I call ‘shimmery waste,’ which incorporates both queer and environmental theories. I base this approach on the analysis of the affective and material entanglements between glitter, queer bodies, and nature, claiming that the problem does not rely on the queer use of glitter per se. Instead, I argue that what needs to be addressed is the importance of context and scale, because these two variables determine the political values of waste and pollution. Finally, I contend that this proposed reframing of the relation between glitter and nature is an inevitable first step in thinking about a queer attitude towards waste and pollution.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

What were the migration-related issues encountered by the women in dealing with the Philippine and Hungarian governments? What are the challenges of living and working in Hungary, and how do Filipina migrant workers address them? How does identity figure in these challenges and the women’s responses to them? In making the above inquiries, the thesis not only broadens the discussion on Filipinas employed abroad in terms of occupation and geographical location, but also challenges essentialist narratives in existing literature on women OFWs. The research was enriched by drawing on the accounts of ten women OFWs in Hungary of different ages, civil status, occupations, and socio-economic backgrounds, with a view to find out as much as possible about their motivations and aspirations. This is important because studies or articles on women OFWs need to account for diverse jobs, personalities, individual circumstances leading to migration, and lived experiences that go beyond abuse, exploitation, or violence to have a fuller view of the women’s complexities.  In order to analyze the information gathered from the women interviewees, a Feminist Global Political Economy (GPE) framework was used. This framework utilizes the feminist perspective to examine the situation of the women OFWs within the global political economy, which involves different actors and elaborate domestic-international, private-public, local-global, and south-north interactions. Concepts from intersectional and post-colonial theories were also incorporated to account for intersecting gender, race, and class identities of Filipinas as women of color, Asians, and “Third World women.”  The thesis will show that “Filipinas” and “overseas Filipina workers” are not homogeneous categories and they have various reasons for leaving the Philippines and residing in Hungary, as well as various ways of responding to challenges posed by transnational labor migration. The women OFWs contend with restrictive state power in the form of regulated entry, residence, and exit, along with the discourse of the Philippine government that constructs them as objects that are naturally meant to be marketed as overseas labor. Filipinas in Hungary deal with gendered and racialized notions of who they are as women, workers, and partners. They also encounter racism and issues with migration and employment. However, In the milieu of neoliberal globalization where state and transnational business interests prevail, the women have had to rely on themselves and their informal networks for survival and development given the lack of support or services offered by the Philippine and Hungarian governments.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Employing methodological and theoretical approaches from gender and transnational history along with nationalism scholarship and legal history, this thesis demonstrates that national belonging in post-WW1 Alsace was negotiated in a dynamic, multi-layered, and gendered manner. In contrast to conceptualisations of the ‘civic’ character of France, French authorities and Alsatian residents invoked both civic and ethnic conceptions of belonging. Dismissing the option of minority rights for the Alsatian population, French administrators allocated privileges and rights according to family descent to determine who ‘belonged’ and was ‘foreign’; petitioners in turn co-opted gendered narratives of Alsatian Francophilia and nested belonging to link their local lived experiences to the nation. The identity cards challenged patrilineal descent and derivative citizenship. Female and male petitioners alike accessed gendered avenues to national belonging by using family members as proxy, yet their appeals reinforced gendered roles of women as ethno-cultural assimilators and men as civic participants in the nation.

This approach offers a more holistic understanding of the ethnic return migration that can account for how demographic changes such as fertility rate, education, shortage of particular labor force and globalization are closely interwoven with economy and politics in South Korea. I contend that it is this set of processes that constitute a biopolitical regime in South Korea within which low-skilled ethnic return migration policies have been developing, and it is within this biopolitical regime Koryo Saram are being racialized as inferior other Koreans.

Due to the consequences of the social-economic-political system which maintains the power and privileges of white, middle-class men in Europe, the vast majority of Roma women have not been in a position that would allow them to influence discourses about knowledge production. Their experiences were therefore not taken into account. But as Michel Foucault said, „Where there is power, there is resistance” (Foucault, 1978, 95), so it was just a matter of time for Roma women to start reacting collectively and challenge mainstream knowledge production. Inspired by scholarly works women of color have published in the USA since the 1908s, Roma feminist scholars, activists, and artists are challenging mainstream knowledge production about “Roma” in Europe and worldwide. The aim of this thesis is to discuss Roma feminist knowledge production, which challenges mainstream knowledge about Roma, by drawing on the lived experiences, culture and traditions of the Romani people, from their social-political-economic standpoints in the societies.

The thesis draws on the theory of gender capital and feminine capital (Huppatz, 2009; McCall, 1992) and poses the following research question: Are the feminine and/or female capitals possessed by crèche employees capitalized on also by BDDSZ? It also analyzes the gendered nature of BDDSZ’s operation and the ways in which this is similar or different to the gendered operation of the crèche and looks at how crèche employees capitalize on femininity and femaleness. The study is based on data from participant observation during an internship at BDDSZ and fifteen interviews with union members and leadership. I argue that while crèche employees utilize feminine and female capitals in their profession, BDDSZ does not, and relies primarily on masculinity and masculine organizational norms instead. I demonstrate that crèche employees draw on female capital because there is a requirement to have a female body in the profession and build on feminine capital because they can become better workers if they display stereotypically feminine qualities and skills. Through the utilization of these capitals, crèche employees exclude men from the field, achieve work-life balance, and draw satisfaction and meaning from their job. Meanwhile, BDDSZ does not utilize feminine or female capitals. Whereas the ideal worker norm (Acker, 1990; Williams, 2000) is challenged in the crèche, it is reinforced in the union as members and officials are expected to invest significant time and energy into activism. Union leadership is expected to draw on stereotypically masculine qualities and skills. The organizational logic of the union is gender-neutral where there is a lack of awareness of the gendered nature of both crèche work and union activism. This thesis expands on the scholarly literature on gender capital through demonstrating that in some contexts, not only masculinity or maleness can be of value but also demonstrates the limitations of utilizing femininity as capital, as well as the wielding of masculinity by women and the wielding of femininity by men. Scholarly work on women and unionism is also addressed through demonstrating that a public-sector union with a fully feminized membership and leadership does not challenge traditional, male-dominated unionism in the Hungarian context. Furthermore, the research contributes to the literature on gender and work by analyzing an occupation where the glass escalator (Williams, 1992) does not benefit men and where the ideal worker norm can be challenged within the field. Examining these questions in the post-socialist context of Hungary where unions historically had a different role than in Western countries and where traditional gender roles and an anti-gender discourse is prevalent is important because it yields different results than in the Anglo-American contexts. Understanding the conflict between the gendered nature of crèche and union is important to possibly push towards more effective organization.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Time as a resource, reflecting the power relations, is distributed unequally within the groups of people, with some spending most of the time working to ensure survival, while others are enjoying vast amounts of discretionary time. In contemporary society, the lack of time is especially acute in the lives of working mothers. The persistent essentialist understanding of motherhood still requires women to devote most of their time beyond paid employment to caregiving, and the standard working hours not taking the time needed for care responsibilities into account. This thesis explores the time poverty experienced by working mothers in Georgia who, due to unregulated working hours and the demands of motherhood, enjoy little to no temporal autonomy. The aim of the research is to analyze the perceptions of time for them and study the ways in which they distribute their time between paid labor, unpaid labor, and leisure and the reasoning behind this arrangement. I argue that the perception of time for working mothers in Georgia, shaped by the essentialist understanding of motherhood, is malleable and adaptable to immediate circumstances, different from the rigidity of capitalist temporality. The data collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews suggest that women perceive time poverty as their individual problem instead of questioning structural inequality leading to this condition; respondents assume that they have more control over their time than they actually do. Over the years, they have adopted different time management and time-saving strategies in order to utilize their time beyond paid employment and meet the contradictory standards of a good employee and a good mother. For this, they often have to juggle several tasks at a time, seek paid or unpaid help from other females, sacrifice their professional growth and leisure time, and put extensive effort into scheduling every minute of their days.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

After introducing a theoretical framework that builds upon the convergences of critical psychology and feminist phenomenology, I use the methodology of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to discuss the way two young women living at a Temporary Home of Families in Budapest, Hungary interpret the sexual and romantic aspects of their lives. I argue that the participants’ social positions, characterized by poverty and the constant struggle not to live in poverty, add central layers of classed meaning to their accounts. I discuss the six master themes emerging from the IPA case study as a gendered trajectory ranging from the past (characterized by abusive environments and threatening homes which the participants left behind) to the future (that may be “built” at the temporary space of the shelter and that is connected to a hope of social mobility). Romantic relationships and sexual experiences represent a “reciprocal island” for the two women, granting an intertwined sense of bodily, emotional and economic safety from a threatening outside world. I discuss the two women’s negotiations of normative womanhood – such as separating themselves from images that represent life in poverty or claiming the normative identity of the good mother (e.g. Csányi and Kerényi, 2018) – as a form of symbolic upward mobility which I connect to Lauren Berlant’s concept of “cruel optimism” (Berlant, 2011). My thesis is the first study to use Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis in researching the sexual and romantic lives of women living in poverty. Beside responding to a gap in psychological research, it is also a “pilot study” that demonstrates the usefulness of feminist phenomenology, queer phenomenology (Ahmed, 2006), and IPA for critical psychological research.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Delving into the ambiguity of ‘third-world woman’, the multiplicity of her identities, and impossibility of her representation, this thesis examines how intersectionality as a conceptual framework can be utilised to deconstruct dominant narratives that present themselves as credible truths. It further explores how dominant discourses and interpretations produce a truth effect through tautological references and reiterations as well as through material manifestations. To do so, this thesis first reframes intersectionality as a property of particles existing in chaos within a complex system. Through a synthesis of postcolonial and feminist literature as well as concepts of dimension-reduction from mathematics, a conceptual framework is built on the axioms of multidimensionality, situatedness, power, and temporality. The framework makes a theoretical claim that interpretations are attempts to linearise chaos with a logic of order based on comparison, continuity, and causality, which produce a frame of reference for subsequent interpretations. In order to contextualise the framework, the thesis maps a prominent journalist’s interpretation of the Nellie massacre of 1983 where more women and children were thought to be killed than young men. The interpretation is deconstructed to reveal assumptions behind the clustering of the groups and the logics of order that linearise chaos of the past. Four alternative causal-effect chains leading to the same outcome are mapped in a complex system comprising socio-political components using an adaptation of backward induction method. The thesis accomplishes this through an exploration of narratives from survivors, perpetrators, local representatives, journalists’ reports, official statements, and eyewitness accounts. This exercise demonstrates that linear patterns identified in chaos are influenced by the dominant discourses that create a feedback loop. The role of power, both discursive and material, is emphasised in crowding out narratives that do not fit into dominant frames of reference. Furthermore, this thesis makes a case for actualising feminist emancipatory politics beyond the analysis of gender on two fronts: on a methodological level, by lending its tools for analysis of similarly ambiguous categories of ‘indigenous’ and ‘immigrant’, and on a practical level, by endeavouring to alleviate material deprivations, as logics of subjugation are maintained through a co-existence of rhetoric and material reality in a complex system. Finally, the thesis offers a reflexive note on the embeddedness of the researcher in the global systems of power operating within academia and frames of references that despite critical analyses continue to shape lived experiences.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The women interviewed come from a heterogenous sample of various ages, industries and migration reasons. I demonstrate how the three support networks: family, cultural enclave, and non-profits and organizations encourage them to pursue both entrepreneurship and motherhood fulltime, thus applying the concept of mompreneurship. Each support network provides insight as to how the respondents interacts with support. I discuss the type of support sent by these three support networks and how the support is used by the women to manage both their roles. Additionally, I argue these three support networks influence them to pursue a contemporary version of the American Dream along with imposing a neoliberal mentality for self-productivity. These support networks work together to provide genuine assistance and independence to the respondents that is not provided by the American economy. The aid the support networks provide to the sample of women is so they can become fully responsible for their business ownership and motherhood to create the image of a working and professional migrant woman. Yet, in doing this they are further encouraging women to increase their productivity. As the respondents are taking on both roles of motherhood and entrepreneurship, they inadvertently provide a solution to the “crisis of care.” With this thesis I also provide insight for the American context on how Mexican and Latinx women are creating their own spaces in industries where they have not been previously been able to enter.

In order to conduct a thorough investigation of the intersectional discrimination suffered by Roma women and the outcome of their oppression, I will use the framework of intersectionality and explore the concepts of resistance developed by Roma women. Thus, by taking the cases of Romani women who are left in extreme poverty in Romania and, therefore, “forced” to migrate as a strategy of survival to provide for them and their families, I will analyze both the intersectional experiences of Roma women and the forms of resistance they have developed as a way in resisting oppression.Hence, this study also aims to challenge the previous research made on Roma migration to Norway and Western countries by tackling the missing female experiences of Romani women in light of their multifaceted forms of discrimination that stem from being women, Roma, poor, migrants, and homeless.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

To do this research in Berlin, I am utilizing qualitative research methods, namely, field visits, autoethnography, participant observation, field journals and oral history. Through a reinterpretation of W.E.B Du Bois’ “double-consciousness” I shall analyze the intersections between black European women and non-European black women understanding how both groups are positioned within Berlin’s logic of “multiculturalism”. I want to outline and analyze which mechanisms may offer advantages or disadvantages to these two groups of black women depending on which differences (class, citizenship rights, sexuality, gender, age, nationality, languages spoken, familial relations, migration history and religion) may or may not intersect under given circumstances. I understand the concept of consciousness serves as a metaphor for understanding the political and collective implications of being gendered and racialized as Black women in the West. I argue that the othering caused by racism and sexism affects Black women differently than it would affect other groups, especially non-European Black women migrants that may have more limited access to networks of support. I conclude that Black women’s self-definition is the first step in reclaiming consciousness against different forms of discrimination, and that Black women (European and non-European) create a variety of strategies to respond to how they are positioned. Finally, through this research I wish to contribute to the ongoing dialogue between Black Feminism and Feminist approaches to Decolonial and Post-Colonial theories.

The study examines the services two NGOs in Lebanon provide to WDWs, most of them being migrants. The central question is how NGOs operating in Lebanon challenge the status quo of women domestic worker’s marginalization in the Lebanese society, and what are the hidden stereotypes of the NGO work. The lens through which the study looks at WDWs is through the discrimination which they face due to the intersection of gender, race and class. A key pillar of WDW’s difficult situation in Lebanon is their exclusion from the labor law and from the entire legal framework. The data collection of this thesis is accomplished in three ways: through qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted virtually with NGO participants, through information collected from resources about NGOs operating in Lebanon, and via the insider position/knowledge of the author, who worked in one of the NGOs the thesis focuses on. The interviewees have experience working with WDWs, either in NGOs in Lebanon, or through their collaboration with different NGOs in Lebanon. This thesis focuses on one of the indirect services, NGOs supporting WDWs in Lebanon provide, which is awareness raising. The thesis argues that the awareness raising provided by the two NGOs being studied, KAFA and Caritas Lebanon, entails stereotypes based on gender, race and class, which in their turn reinforce and regenerate the already existing injustices. The hidden stereotypes I analyze, are those that bound the domestic work field in Lebanon to women from disadvantaged class and racial background. Moreover, I analyze the views of my seven NGO participants and demonstrate that the views of most of the participants in this research include similar hidden stereotypes parallel to the ones present within the awareness raising activities done by the two NGOs in focus.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The recent feminist contribution to nominate and criminalize femi(ni)cide has provided instruments for social and legal analysis to prevent these avoidable—yet recurrent— deaths. This study explores judicial contributions that confront gender-based violence in cases of femi(ni)cides ‘resulting from contempt or discrimination against women’ in Brazil (article 121, 2 paragraph A, II). In light of the recent criminalization of femi(ni)cide in the country (2015), the judiciary system acquired instruments to address women’s homicide based on gender. While the first clause of the law relates to the already criminalized family and domestic violence against women, the second institues a novel approach by addressing non-intimate femi(ni)cides (defined as the murder of a woman based on gender by someone with whom she did not have a relationship). After five years of law enforcement, the judicial interpretations of the latter have not yet been investigated by scholars. By correlating the disputes during the approval of the law to the initial jurisprudence of non-intimate femi(ni)cide cases, I analyze judicial response to femi(ni)cide cases through a feminist and decolonial legal perspective which seeks to recover the memories of these women rather than to simply refer to them as numbers in the system. Understanding legal discourses as a limited and yet crucial sphere in which to confront gender-based violence, I analyze judicial contributions that combat gender-based violence whilst judging cases of femi(ni)cides. In this thesis, I argue that even in its limited capacity, judicial contribution using this feminist category of analysis represents important progress on legal discourses and practices to confront gender-based violence.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

These events began in reaction to a homonormative and exclusionary permanent gay nightlife scene. I begin by providing background about Madison, its queer subculture, and the racial and class dynamics within the city. In the first chapter, I address the complications of defining queerness and community in both academic and organizing work, engaging in theoretical understandings of both terms, as well as incorporating the definitions and understandings of research participants. I use discourse analysis to parse the descriptions of several queer pop-up events in Madison and the political engagements of both permanent gay bars and Queer Pressure, a significant queer pop-up event series. In the second chapter, I begin with an analysis of the notion of the sacred within th scene, then move to engage with Jack Halberstam’s concepts of queer temporality and spatiality to consider the implications and possibilites of pop-up and queer takeover style events, in part by reflecting on sets, the spaces the parties take place in, and the transient nature of event series and Madison queers. In the third chapter, I take up the question of queer politics and intersectionality by reading Micheal Warner’s definition of queer politics alongside Lisa Duggan’s conception of the homonormative, and reflect on the resonances of intersectionality and crip theory within these frameworks. I then discuss the homonormative politics of the Madison LGBTQ+ community, and contrast them with an analysis of Queer Pressure’s political commitments. The final section of this chapter is a case study of the No Cops at Pride movement, reactions to and consequences of its engagement with radical queer politics, and a brief analysis of the resonance of this movement in 2018 with the racial justice mass movement of 2020.

In particular, the thesis examines the discussion between “aristocrats” and “nihilists” and their conflict during the campaign for women’s higher education (1868), which resulted with separation of radical women, who were dissatisfied with the exclusion of class question, established Alarchin Courses and further preferred to cooperate with the political underground of Saint Petersburg to promote their agenda.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I observe two dominant trends in the construction of the image of French-Maghrebi women: the beurette and the Muslim woman who wears the Hijab. First, I follow the emergence of the beurette, which was commonly used to refer to the second-generation French woman of North African descent in the 1980’s. I argue that a contradictory stance was assigned to this figure. She was construed as a victim of North African-Muslim patriarchy, a retrograde gender system and an oppressive domestic life. At the same time, she was depicted as a heroine who can benefit from assimilating into French society and who could effectively lead to the elevation of her community into the modern, secular and gender progressive French society. Second, I follow the evolution of this representational figure in feminist discourses during the early 2000’s by using the self-defined secular Maghrebi feminist collective “Ni Putes Ni Soumises” as a case-study. I demonstrate that the circulation of the highly mediatized and celebrated figures of the collective were mobilized for racist ends by hegemonic feminism and the state apparatus alike. Thirdly, I trace the representation of French-Muslim women who wear the Hijab in the public media. Through the three controversial headscarf affairs in 1989, 1994 and 2003 which sought to discuss the right of young Muslim girls to wear the Hijab in public schools, I argue that the veiled woman was portrayed as a threatening figure that transgresses and offends the foundations of the French republic. I demonstrate that the two ambivalent figures of French-Maghrebi women loomed large in French public and political lives and were mobilized against each other. I assert that the production, circulation and reception of these representational figures constitute a pivotal site in understanding the French construction of a Muslim difference with reference to gendered and sexualized repertoires. I also demonstrate the hyper-visibility of this gendered-racialized other can be a pivotal site to unravel the history of French republicanism as a process operating on dynamics of exclusion and othering of a post-colonial immigrant community.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This project provides an analysis of the current day situation of the Palestinian women’s movement by first understanding how the past has played a role in forming the present. Arguing that the women’s movement in Palestine today is one that is deeply fractured and weak, the three chapters of this research project demonstrate how this weakness unraveled temporally. During the First Intifada, the women’s movement started losing its momentum by aligning itself with an inherently masculine movement; namely the national resistance movement. Further, the Oslo agreement failed Palestinian women by excluding them from the process in its entirety, just as transitional justice theories historically failed to truly include women. This research examines the “secularism myth” (Braidotti et al. (2014)) that was employed by the Palestinian Authority as a new approach aimed at attracting foreign aid. It proposes an urgent need for a postsecular debate within Palestinian politics in order to achieve a discourse that is free from the secular/ religious binary, allowing space for true gender equality and woman empowerment to ultimately emerge. The PA was a favorable receiver of Western aid, allowing universal feminist agendas to established INGOs programs which sought to liberate and empower Palestinian women. Targeting women through these highly funded programs, obstructed the way in which the women’s movement operated in Palestine. To overcome this challenge, this research project ends by making a second proposition to use Mohanty’s (2002) “anticapitalist transitional feminist practice” as a way forward in order to break away from dependence on a globalized feminist discourse, and to go back to creating an authentic Palestinian feminist voice that calls for liberation from all layers of oppression.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I locate the anti-gender discourse in the Estonian context, drawing out its main tactics: self-victimization, being triggered by specific events, and instrumentalising the anti-communist and nationalist elements that are embedded in the social and historical context that the anti-gender actors operate in. Then, I conduct case studies on events in Estonia where the use of ‘hysteria’ and ‘witch-hunt’ has become particularly salient. In the case of ‘hysteria’, I analyse the media coverage of a theatre director’s act of violence against a woman, the media coverage of a feminist campaign condemning the further platforming of this person, and the public anti-feminist outcry that followed in 2017–2018. These events were a part of establishing ‘hysteria’ in the Estonian public discourse as a tactic to discredit gender and obstruct further criticism of violence against women. In the case of ‘witch-hunt’, I analyse the media coverage of the far-right populist party EKRE upon their admission to the Parliament of Estonia in 2015. I look at the political criticism that EKRE’s members received for using racist language and advocating for fascism, and their tactic of titling this criticism ‘a witch-hunt’, comparable with Donald Trump’s use of the term. I draw out how the ‘witch-hunt’ discourse has structural similarities with the anti-gender discourse and how it appropriates a historical gender order in order to diffuse accountability of politically powerful men. The aim of the analysis I conduct in this thesis is to explore how gender has become discredited in a broader sense than the particular anti-gender campaigns observed in the existing literature. I also aim to explore the implications of the normalisation of this discrediting and articulate the tactics that the discourses of ‘hysteria’ and ‘witch-hunt’ entail.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Gimbutas’ utopian antimodernist vision became a source of inspiration for a variety of socio-political movements (environmentalist, feminist, neo-pagan, among others) in diverse geographical contexts, on both sides of and transgressing the “Iron Curtain”, starting with the 1970s and reaching a peak during the 1990s. This dissertation analyzes how Gimbutas’ work and persona were received, constructed and appropriated, and sometimes rejected, in diverse contexts, namely, archaeology and feminist archaeology, the feminist spirituality movement in the United States and post-socialist Lithuanian feminism. The dissertation combines historical methods with theoretical perspectives developed in feminist and postcolonial/postsocialist studies to produce a critical account of Gimbutas’ life and work, as well as to discuss how various actors have related to and made use of her ideas. In doing so, it sheds light on some questions of broader theoretical and historiographical significance for feminism and critical gender scholarship transnationally. Examining feminist activist and scholarly engagement with Gimbutas’ controversial vision of Old Europe, this dissertation reveals some of the “political ambivalence” inherent to feminism, considered as simultaneously a product and a critique of modernity. In particular, this dissertation interrogates questions of scientific objectivity, gender essentialism, and Eurocentrism, as they appear in the feminist debates and gender politics, centered around Gimbutas’ work and persona. Focusing on the figure of Gimbutas this dissertation challenges the narrative of Western feminism as “the norm”, and Eastern Europe as only a recipient of feminist ideas and politics. Instead, it proposes an alternative history, where women’s politics both in “the East” and “the West” have been shaped by the Cold War division of the world, and continue to be affected by other transnational hierarchies, divisions and encounters. Much of the interest in Gimbutas’ theory of Old Europe can be understood as a symptom of the general disappointment with the traditional ideologies of the Left and Right around the time of the fall of the “Iron Curtain”, and a search for alternative moral frameworks in the period, often characterized as “postmodern” and/or “postsocialist” – the 1980s and the 1990s.', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2376k)', 'Local note': 'Unrestricted'}"

I formulate the problem of disembodiment as rooted in the notion of the boundless (apeiron) associated with femininity. Both boundlessness and disembodiment are subject to radicalization in Plato (chōra) and Plotinus (to hen). Read as a dyad, they culminate in a tendency towards gendered disembodiment, mediated by Plato’s soul-body dualism. The dissertation seeks to compare the gendered dimension of disembodiment in the work of Plato and Plotinus and that of the non-philosophers François Laruelle and Katerina Kolozova. “Part I. The Problem of Boundlessness: Radicalizing Disembodiment” is divided in three chapters, which present an intellectual history of the problem of boundlessness as femininity. I survey the problem of boundlessness as drafting relations between elements and principles and femininity in Greek mythology (Chapter 1), Plato’s cosmology (Chapter 2), and Plotinus’ metaphysics (Chapter 3). I argue that the relation between death and the female was ambivalent by the time of the Anaximandrean apeiron and that it became a subject of radicalization via Plato’s chōra and Plotinus’ One, mediated by the notion of the Indefinite Dyad and the doctrine of divided matter. The problem of boundlessness was subject to conceptual radicalization that led to hierarchical metaphysics and deepened the division between body and soul via the association of femininity, reproductivity and matter. “Part II. The Problem of Disembodiment: Revising Boundlessness” is divided in two chapters focusing on the contemporary relevance and importance of the problem of disembodiment as a way of revising boundlessness. I present and explain the legacy of the Platonic chōra and the Plotinian One and what they as a dyad entail for contemporary continental philosophy. I offer (Chapter 4) a trajectory for a continental feminist philosophy interpretation of disembodiment by combining continental feminist philosophy, non-philosophy and new realism. With the aid of Laruelle’s non-philosophy, I explain how and why chōra and the One can be used for/from continental feminist philosophy, followed by a presentation of how chōra and the One are revised in continental philosophy from non-philosophical and new realist perspectives. I then develop (Chapter 5) a continental feminist philosophical interpretation of and approach to the problem of disembodiment from a realist perspective by problematizing continental and feminist philosophical anti-realism. The approach presented is itself an argument in defence of a feminist engagement with disembodiment and the dissertation’s contribution: a non-philosophical contribution to the problem of disembodiment via a continental feminist-realist philosophical approach. The approach is offered through the intersection of continental feminist realism and non-philosophy, and partially new realism. My conclusion is that an affirmative project and consideration of disembodiment for continental feminist philosophy is possible via a non-philosophical and new realist reconsideration of the One.', 'File Type': 'Unrestricted', 'Access': 'PDF file (1733k)', 'System Det': 'PDF', 'Local note': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Several actors emerge as central players in shaping the meanings and politics of ‘the sexual’ in Beirut today: the Lebanese state and its security apparatus, LGBT-rights NGOs and activists, ‘queer’ bars, and Syrian refugees. These actors continuously configure the politics of gender and sexual non-normativity and sexual subjectivity in relation to power, profit, space, kinship, and displacement. Prevalent scholarly approaches to gender and sexual non-normativity in the Middle East (West Asia) have been caught in a debate over local authenticity on the one hand and imperial imposition and mimicry on the other. I argue for a way out of this bind. In line with post-structuralism, I propose ‘cross-bracing’ as a theoretical structure that captures ‘the sexual’ as a set of unequal and cross-dependent interactions among dominant forces of the local, regional, and transnational. Cross-bracing reveals the dynamic interactions among these unequal forces as they constitute and are constituted by each other, and through movement, interdependence, and friction. In order to understand how persons and institutions navigate these cross-braced structures, I introduce the concept of ‘hedging’ sexualities. My interlocutors invest in what appear to be multiple and contradictory gendered and sexual identities, acts, bodily performances, and politics. In doing so, they minimize their risk of losing power as guards of morality (the state apparatus), manage their risks of closure and policing (LGBT NGOs) and of raids and lost profits (‘queer’ bars), and balance building alternative queer kinship networks with the chance of resettlement (gender and sexually non-normative Syrian refugees). As my interlocutors hedge their gendered sexualities, they show us ways to exist in parallel, in contradiction, and in tension. Based on a feminist queer ethnographic approach, this dissertation contributes ‘cross-bracing’ and ‘hedging’ as a novel conceptual framework to theorizations of gender and non-normative sexualities in Beirut, as well as to the field of anthropological studies of gender and sexuality at large.', 'File Type': 'Unrestricted', 'Access': 'PDF file (1842k)', 'System Det': 'PDF', 'Local note': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Taking a queer, post-colonial perspective on transnational governmentality of bodies and sexuality, the research shows the friction between working-class queer women and NGO spaces in this regard. Firstly, this dissertation focuses on the disconnect between NGOs that purport to work with sexual minorities and their inability to connect with ‘lesbians,’ including those queer women who attend NGO events, and focuses on how technologies of recognition and confession are carried through NGO spaces, as a form of neoliberal transnational governmentality. In this vein, this work examines the ways in which certain cis-gender male dominated NGOs in Accra have come to be historically reliant on northern donor (public health) funding through HIV interventions, and how these NGOs rely on individuals to “come out” to participate in NGO services through categories of risk. Following this, the dissertation explores the more recent interest of these NGOs to include of all of those under the “LGBT umbrella,” including ‘lesbians,’ in their work. This dissertation specifically focuses on participant observation with a core group of queer women, who maneuvered through increasingly professionalized NGO spaces that sought to include them in their work. Through a focus on lived realities and participation in NGOs, this dissertation shows how this group came to embody the friction between supposedly ‘local’ norms regarding sexuality in the post-colonial Ghana context, and transnational forces, while staying true to their desires although they were often labeled as the product of ‘foreign’ influences. Through accounts of time spent in homes, bars, NGO spaces and trainings, and on the social media application, WhatsApp, I show how a nyaanyo (the Ga term for friend) counter public was created by these individuals as a space of their own, through which a complexity and multiplicity of desire and experience was articulated. Eventually, I show how the “Courageous Sisters” NGO was formed as an NGO based on the nyaanyo counter public formed in WhatsApp, a case which highlighted the multifariousness of contextualizing queer women’s experiences while also showing the importance of digital communities for expressing embodied realities, creating counter public discourses, forming belonging, and maneuvering a context in which working-class queer women were seen as victims in need of intervention by NGO’s.', 'Access': 'English', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1934k)'}"

In this project I analyze how gender, race/ethnicity, and class play role in shaping medical concerns. And how do medical sciences contribute to empowerment in different historical periods. I was initially interested in how geneticists are producing knowledge about Roma people within Europe and more specifically in Hungary. I started my work with one very narrow question in mind: whether these works contribute to the geneticization of race/ethnicity as Troy Duster, Jonathan Kahn, Dorothy Roberts, Carolyn M. Rouse and many other scholars claim, and if yes, in what ways they do. I was interested in contemporary medical genetic discussions but I was aware that this discourse has continuities with the medical genetic discussions of the socialist period. In order to explore the commonalities and differences between these two, I did 35 interviews with medical geneticists and biologists who take part in research, teaching, or genetic counseling. These were in-depth semi-structured interviews in which I asked about their specific fields, about the continuities that they see with socialist medical aims regarding reproduction, how they see the role of race/ethnicity, gender, and class in shaping genetic concerns, and how would they describe the social relevance of their work. In the interviews I inquired how they view their work in relation to eugenics and their replies pointed towards connections between their work and the eugenic arguments of the early twentieth century. Thus, I became interested in the comparative analysis of eugenic thinking in the Hungarian medical discourse in two historically distant periods. Specifically, the early 1900s and 1910s when eugenics entered the Hungarian medical discourse with the present medical genetic concerns closely connected with the socialist medical practice. Medical genetics as a discipline emerged in the 1960s as a result of biotechnological developments. In the Hungarian literature medical genetic studies were first published around the end of the 60s. Institutions, that incorporated medical genetic knowledge to aid reproductive decision making such as genetic counseling institutes, were established in the 70s. Among the early concerns the degeneration of the population appeared similarly to the early eugenic discourse thus I think it is possible to establish connections between these two. In the early medical genetic publications of the 1970s the main concern was the possible transmission of ’bad’ genes for the future generations and the role that medical genetics could play to avoid that outcome. Their focus was on the female body but explicitly racial or ethnic concerns were not present in genetic argumentation until the early 1980s, although ethnicity based medical studies have appeared in the 1960s and 70s. The aim of population genetic works is to compare the genetic structure of Roma and non-Roma Hungarians in order to design screening panels that would improve the management of their healthcare. I think regarding these medical efforts one of the question to look at is how genetic knowledge empowers people at the intersection of the social categories of gender, class, race/ethnicity? In what ways do geneticists molecularize these social categories? And what are the possible ethical consequences of this practice?', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I propose that the family is a prime site of intimate citizenship, as it is regulated by the state and mainstream discourses, but also because its functioning either complies with or challenges societal norms concerning the inclusion or exclusion of same-sex couples. In this sense, heterosexual family members can also stand up for or hinder the intimate citizenship of their non-heterosexual kin. At the same time, the family of origin of same-sex couples themselves have to manage a similar stigma to that of non-heterosexuals, but often without the discursive resources provided by the LGBTQ community.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

These questions underlie much of the philosophy of media and technology, and they provide the context in which this project wishes to situate itself. I aim to investigate the construction of human-media relationships in the biopolitical arrangements of postindustrial capitalism, in which the management of the somatic individual and the regulations of its various intimacies play a prominent role. I argue that contemporary media addictions, such as Internet and gaming addiction, exist as paradigmatic formulations of the way in which biopolitical subjects engage with media; more than that, media addictions are pivotal in sustaining the production and maintenance of a media-infused ‘politics of life itself’ (In Nikolas Rose’s formulation). In order to support this argument, I will investigate some possibilities to reformulate the ontological basis of media-human relationships so as to re-read media addiction as a self-affirming and fruitful intimacy with the in/nonhuman, i.e. media technologies, based on desire, pleasure and drive towards alternative relationalities. This project can be distilled into three main theoretical strands: the exploration of the biopoliticization of the phenomenon of media addiction one the one hand, a potential refiguration of media use as a form of intimacy with the in- and non-human on the other, and finally an investigation into the place of gender and materiality within media philosophy. The crux of the project is the proposition that the ontology of media, in the context of Western metaphysics, is in a perpetual oscillation between the poles of humanity and nonhumanity. Because of this unstable process, media technology is positioned as a threatening figuration that destabilizes the privilege accorded to the category of the human, while at the same time redrawing its boundaries. Contemporary Western biopolitics, the ‘politics of life itself’, relies precisely on the uncertain status of media in order to codify the character of the media addict as a paradigmatic figure of the contemporary climate, as a techno-somatic individual. The goal of the work is to understand the role of media within contemporary Western biopolitics, and to survey the dynamics between the various ontological states attributed to media in political and academic discourse, and the human users who engage with them.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Drawing on the narratives of forcibly displaced people living in Bogotá, this research highlights the links between the dynamics of race, gender, class, sex and ethnicity that lie beneath this city’s spatial order and the mechanisms of violence and intra-urban displacement that shape displaced people’s urban experiences. Despite the expectations that Bogotá’s urban renewal would bring about a homogenous city, this research shows that this process has not been able to overturn the city’s segregated spatial order north-rich-white vs. south-poor-mestizo. It highlights that, in so doing, the existing urban order has allowed a continuum of gendered violence to flow from rural areas of armed conflict to the city as well as the re-emergence of forms of exploitation. This research therefore examines how such mechanisms hinder forcibly displaced people, particularly displaced women, from overcoming victimization and participate in deepening their socio-spatial exclusion. Through this research, I seek to contribute to the existing literature on global South cities by excavating the spatial and gender-related challenges faced by urban societies undergoing democratic transitions such as post-conflict situations. Based on eight months of fieldwork conducted in 2012, combined with media and discourse analysis as well as archival research undertaken up to 2016, the analysis brings to the fore displaced people’s itineraries of displacement, including the paths they have covered through their experiences of mourning, survival or resistance. Inspired by feminist political thinkers and geographers as well as postcolonial urban scholars, this research proposes a gendered right to the city aimed at two interrelated purposes. First, as a methodological platform from which to identify the hurdles faced by displaced people in their struggles to overcome their condition of victim and, second, as a venue to enable this population the chance to access transformative transitional justice in the cities they have come to inhabit.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

These critiques raise issues around the treatment of nonhuman animals, the relationship with the environment, and the uses of technology, and when approached through the intersection of posthumanist/environmental/animal studies, they are seen to fall back on certain humanist assumptions. I identify five key scenarios through which the human-nonhuman biopolitics of the classic Gothic sci-fi is staged (and which persist to unfold in contemporary cultural imagination): technological creation of the non/human, wonder/terror/horror at the nonhuman, alienation from (human) nature, disastrous extinction of the human species, and biological invasions of the human self.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I go as far back as the late eighteenth century when the zoo underwent transformation from a private menagerie to the modern enterprise of a public zoological garden, which involved scientific, economic and political goals. I look closely at evolutionary discourses emerging at that time. Following Foucault, I argue that sexuality plays a central role in scientific truth-making. With my research I also show that the category of the nonhuman animal is crucial in negotiating the boundaries of humanness and that this process necessarily happens through the mapping of sexual, gendered, racial, and classed subjectivities. I do this by focusing on contemporary cases of “queer zoo animals” that have become centers of public debates on naturalness of homosexuality and gender in the Euro-American context.

The dissertation offers a political history of Kemalist feminism that enables an insight into the intertwined relationship between women's activism and the politics of gender. It focuses on the class, national/ethnic, and cultural/religious dynamics of and their implications for Kemalist feminist politics. In so doing, it situates Kemalist feminist activism within the politics of gender in Turkey; that is, it analyzes the relationship between Kemalist feminist activism and other actors in gender politics, such as the state, transnational governance, political parties, civil society organizations, and feminist, Islamist, and Kurdish women's activisms. The analysis of Kemalist feminist activism provided in this dissertation draws on a methodological-conceptual framework that can be summarized as follows. Activism provides the ground for women to become actors of the politics of gender. At the same time, the relations of power and systems of inequality that dominate the field of formal politics also infiltrate the field of civil society and women's activism thereof. Thus, women's activism is always-already marked by class, national/ethnic, and cultural/religious struggles; these struggles thereby become the constitutive dynamics of women's gender politics. Therefore, to account for the ways in which women's activism influences, reproduces, and/or challenges the politics of gender in a specific historical context, it is necessary to analyze the strategies women employ both to seek women's gender interests and to maintain a political framework for defining these interests that is simultaneously class-based, national/ethnic, and cultural/religious.  A further objective of this dissertation is to explore the historical transformation of Kemalist women's politics into Kemalist feminism. By bringing to light the forms of activism adopted by Kemalist women, and the demands they raised—individually and collectively—to further women's rights in Turkey, the study suggests a rewriting of the history of women's activism with a focus on continuities, alongside ruptures, between different, namely the single-party (1923–1946), multi-party (1946–1980), and post-1980, periods.  The dissertation is based on research on the print and online material provided by Kemalist women's and feminist activism and on interviews conducted with Kemalist feminists. The print and online material includes documents, interviews, reports, leaflets, booklets, articles, journals, books, edited volumes, biographical, and autobiographical works that were written or prepared by Kemalist women including Kemalist feminists, or written or prepared by other feminists (activists and scholars, in Turkey and abroad) about Kemalist women and feminists.

My fieldwork consisted of observing sex education and other lessons, semi-structured small-group interviews with cc. 90 students and individual interviews with the school nurse, five teachers and the school director. I analyse topics related to sexuality, including virginity, marriage, hygiene, pleasure, and ways of talking about them, through which my respondents constitute gendered, classed and raced/ethnic subjectivities. I highlight a hitherto neglected use of sexuality in this context. Several researchers have pointed out that schools themselves reproduce gendered, raced and classed inequalities within their walls. I argue that discourses on sexuality in this school constitute binary categories of gender, race/ethnicity and class, and contribute to the formation of students’ subjectivities based on these categories. In other words, sexuality is not only one of the axes of social inequality, it is also constitutive of these axes. The sexuality discourses and practices I have identified and the subjectivities they constitute simultaneously create categories of exclusion and allocate people within and outside, leading to a re-inscription of social inequalities in schooling.

First, while examining the nature of the role of male bodies underlying the theorizing of men and masculinities in the field of the Critical Studies of Men and Masculinities, I argue for a turn to sexual difference theory as an answer to the “gap” between the representational thinking about male bodies and their participation in thought and subjective production. Secondly, sharing Irigaray’s critique of Western thought, in both its philosophical and psychoanalytical instantiations, I examine alternative morphological locations for rethinking the male imaginary in relation to male embodiments, on the one hand, and in relation to the maternal and the feminine, on the other hand. Thirdly, I suggest that a phenomenologically-influenced approach towards male bodies might be productive, especially when thought through Irigaray’s sexual difference as a relational and experiential ontology understood in phenomenological terms. Finally, while showing that Irigaray and Deleuze share a similar critique of Western philosophical thought and of the masculine historical subject, I propose a rethinking of the concept of “becoming-man” as an assemblage meeting between Irigaray’s sexual difference and Deleuze and Guattari’s nomadologic project and as a possibility of thinking change in men’s masculine subjective constitution in relation to both women and men. As far as the ethical implications of such rethinking are concerned, the thesis urges for the cultivation of a masculine culture of stepping back so as to make possible the construction of new spaces that would allow for the becoming of at least two subjects based on the respect for their differences.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

It focuses on the fiction features films from 1947 to 1962, i.e. the period of the most intense developments in Yugoslav cinema, from the very inception of the film industry in the postwar country to the rise of the modernist tendencies, as exemplified by novi film in the 1960s. The thesis strategically (1) uses gender-inflected conceptual and analytical framework, and (2) proposes a new Foucauldian epistemology of Yugoslav cinema, in order to challenge the dominant narratives about the socialist past, as articulated along the lines of the totalitarian paradigm. According to the totalitarian accounts, Yugoslav cinema was primarily the instrument of the Tito’s totalitarian regime run by the obedient propagandist drones. The classical Yugoslav cinema was especially besmirched in the accounts: the films made before the novi film are usually relegated to socialist-realist vehicles for disseminating communist dogmas and lies. This study demonstrates the opposite: characterized by intense developments that cannot be reduced to the stark ideological imperatives, the classical Yugoslav cinema actually testifies to polyphony of motifs and meanings – particularly those related to the gender-related aspects of the “Yugoslav cultural revolution”. Instead of going after an exhaustive scanning of the classical Yugoslav cinema, the study opts to probe in-depth several specific groups of films by applying the gender optics. After the introductory mapping of gender politics and cinema from the late 1940s to early 1960s, and arguing for the new epistemological framework, the thesis showcases gender motifs in the three major groups of classical films: the WWII/partisan films; the films about the post-war reconstruction of the country; and the films about the vicissitudes of peasantry, with other prominent groups of films also tangentially tackled. Rich and complex, spearheaded by antagonisms and paradoxes, the Yugoslav classical cinema actively participated in its vibrant socio-historical climate. Thus it needs to be vindicated and more closely explored as the unique historical imaginary of the early Yugoslav socialist modernity in general, and of the “apparatuses” of gender and sexuality in socialism in particular.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

In modern literate cultures, autobiography as a narrative form has been inextricably linked to the construction of the human subject, and as such, feminist literary history and criticism has also studied various types and manifestations of life writing to examine ways in which the construction of gendered subjectivities is entangled with the (re)constitution of the category of the human. With posthumanist and new materialist accents in theories of subjectivity, there is a growing need and motivation to reexamine the gendered subject of autobiography in order to map the strategies and limits that specify the construction of the category of the human in life narrative, and the ways in which gender as a critical category and a means of identity-construction is invested in the materialization of bodies in terms of these strategies and limits. Autobiography may denote a widely defined framework accommodating variously designed life-writing genres, which have been testing their definitional limits since the beginning of autobiography’s history (Gilmore, Limits 2) in order to try to create a narrative channel for the articulation of their narrators’ subjective life experiences. This articulation brings up a number of issues concerning the representational function of language, and the representability of historical and embodied experience. In the discussion of the autobiographical works selected for this study, I look at these issues as they specifically manifest in the texts, as well as the strategies employed by the authors and their narrators to grapple with the controversies deriving from the autobiographical situation of trying to talk about various senses of “being in the world.” While Szabó uses a fictional doppelgänger to make a parallel-dichotomous construction in which her autobiographical self is developed as a unique but related individual, Polcz’s intent to tell “how things were” is predominantly motivated by a confessional-testimonial ethos, which, however, may be constituted very differently according to which level of interpretation the text is read on. T. N. Kiss’s confession, the thematic organizing principle of which is how to come to terms with a transgendered identity in a particular social-cultural context, suggests that gender is implicated in the human in a variety of ways where both biological and social constructions are bound to be simulatory. Finally, the text (pseudo-)authored and narrated by Laura Spiegelmann constitutes a multilayered drag performance, which, by constantly exposing its own “artificiality,” subverts ideas about the “naturalness” of gender, the construction of autobiographical subjectivity, and their relation to each other. I conclude that autobiography as a specific historical and cultural frame of interpretation and interpellation is also a site where the human as a category is constructed with reference to both the biological and the discursive, in both of which gender as “a term of intelligibility” is deeply implicated.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Having been a women’s organization in the Ukrainian diaspora and an ethnic organization in American and international women’s movements from its inception, the UNWLA often considered its participation in international women’s forums instrumental in promoting the cause of Ukraine’s sovereignty. Instead of withdrawing from this arena in the early years of Ukraine’s independence, however, the UNWLA started to adopt the women’s rights and equality discourses for generating relations with the state and non-state actors in Ukraine and for conceptualizing a vision for the organization’s future. Drawing on fieldwork findings from the New York City branches of the organization, I argue that the current shift in the UNWLA’s relation to women’s rights movement has been triggered not only by the changes in the political status of their homeland, but also by the generational shift in the UNWLA membership as well as by the growing currency of women’s rights discourses in the international politics.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The thesis researches how LGBT/queer art festivals (and in particular the Queer Zagreb Festival in Croatia) used queer visuality in the post-Yugoslav region from 2003 till 2012. This research engages with discussions in the fields of feminist visual studies, cultural studies, queer theory, festival studies, and (queer) anthropology to ask about the influence of visual representation on social changes. Methodologically, my dissertation combines the ethnography of the Queer Zagreb Festival with interview analysis, and close-reading of written and visual Festival materials. Furthermore, my analysis is informed by the concerns of feminist intersectionality and queer approaches to ethnography. I show that while the visuality of the Queer Zagreb Festival aimed for a radical queering of the Croatian public discourses of art and politics, it was framed through the programming of the Festival as the time-space where high art and avant-garde influences meet popular culture. I argue that the practices of regional negotiation of queerness oscillate between the strategies of queering belonging and visuality (of queering the region, art works and identities), and the strategies of creating queer visual representation (of choosing to produce queer/lesbian/gay region, art works and identities). Approaching negotiation as both material and discursive, I explore the ways in which, in particular, the Zagreb festival community negotiates regional queerness through travelling, experiencing festival time-space, and understanding art. I suggest that the post-Yugoslav queer festivals (despite significant differences in artistic and political goals among them) are all engaged in practices of claiming the public space for the display of art works that question sexual and gender normativity. I argue that the opening up of festival chronotopes to non-normative visuality creates temporary free festival spaces of queer sociability. The significance of my project for a broader audience lies in my suggestion that the subversive lesbian and gay and/or queer representations can be read as an index of larger changes in post-socialist sexual and gender hierarchies.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I argue that by re-reading the cases of Stanislavsky, Meyerhold and Artaud through the Freudian psychoanalytical discourse I can identify forms of a particular hysteria – male hysteria – which lies at the heart of these radical texts – allowing the chance for subversion, possibilities to question gender norms and to rethink the performing body when bringing theory into praxis on the stage. My thesis uses multidisciplinary methodological approaches - performance analysis, psychoanalysis, postmodern and feminist epistemology – in its attempt to further the existing discourses on theatre, body, masculinity and male hysteria. The radical modernist theatre practice introduced changes at the level of approaching the body of the actor and the modern function of the director. Starting with the first modernist director, Konstantin Stanislavsky the body on stage is thought in hysterical terms in a spiraling identification actor-director. The linkage between theatricality and male hysteria can become a method of positively claiming the hysterical masculinity as a form of resistance to dominant forms of masculinity and a reevaluation of hysteria today. Male directors speak the language of theatrical hysterics in the sense of developing imaginary a unsteady body that resists representation while the rigorous demands of the symbolic and excitability are not synthesized and the consequence is to compromise through somatic symptoms, affective states and impossible fantasies. The point is to read through hysteria the performing bodies as they are conceptualized in directors’ canonical writing on theatre by exploring the symbolic coding of the body in avant-garde Western theatre practice. A re-reading of these male directors' texts has the potential to undermine the disciplinary forces that are inherent to any canon, to reveal the avoidance of commodification of new forms of radicalism, the undiscovered inherent transgressiveness of those texts and their radical potential invoked in reaching beyond the existing systems of formalized power by creating unimaginable forms of association and action. The hysterical male was perceived historically in negative terms, as unmanly or feminine, as a dangerous denial of masculinity. The link between performance and male hysteria functions as an essential questioning of the body/mind and feminine/masculine dichotomies through a troubling sexual difference which I can relate to a confusion of masculinity and femininity in hysteria. How do we understand acting and theatricality in contemporary Western theatre? A possible answer has to take into consideration the modern rhetoric and practice of rehearsal and training. By introducing the male hysteria element and the feminist psychoanalytical template, I attempt to connect theory to practice in an effort to locate the hysteric in modernist theorized practices of acting nowadays. By identifying the tensions generated by hysterical manifestations, I locate the theoretical points that generated change in the practice and conceptualization of theatrical performance and claim their radical instability in the present."", 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This salient locus is the ideal venue to discuss issues of sexuality, gender, pleasure, emotions and sensations that are not usually part of histories of state socialism. In fact these topics are quite marginal or rendered insignificant when simply circumscribed to the “resistance” paradigm that necessarily accompanied the well-known “totalitarian” paradigm employed to describe experiences in the former Eastern Block. Making the body central to my investigation enabled me to offer three theoretical openings. First, it re-grounded the history of state socialism from the (rather abstract) discussions with ideology, politics and economics towards lived and embodied experiences. Secondly, by making the body central it allowed me to bring in a series of connected topics and phenomena, for example the constitution of bodies during socialism, either normal or deviant that would otherwise be simply relegated to the realm of socialist policy when in fact they dovetail more complex relations. Thirdly, by focusing on the body I was able to bring forth experiences and personal histories of people like the nudists, the yoga practitioners and homosexual men. Their particular common situation within socialism, but also their evident differences, would have been lost without the common theme of the body.  The argument that this dissertation makes is that far from being repressive, the functioning of state socialist regimes itself generated and sustained a broad range of desires and libidinal investments, thus enabling the formation of very complex gendered subjectivities and bodies. State surveillance, its gaze upon the people, its disposition of bodies was traversed by erotic desires and based on sexual pleasures. I argue that what sustained the communist regime was its scopophilia: the voyeuristic pleasure of looking, taking pleasure in looking, in the surveillance itself. Consequently, while sexuality was officially repressed, in fact I will argue that it was affirmed in the very functioning of the regime. This argument brings into discussion immediately the role of the secret police and of secrecy more generally. Secrecy becomes then a focal point of my investigation as a practice that generates arousal itself. Secrecy also elicits the desire to look, to penetrate with the gaze what is hidden and unknown. Secrecy I argue remains inseparable from penetration: the phallocentric affirmation of the regime. For building up my case I use materials such as oral history interviews, secret police archives and memoirs.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

It is about the Wuxu reforms (1898), a historical juncture when neo/Confucian elite tried to position the Chinese Empire more favorably within the symbolic and political hierarchies of the modern world. Differing from earlier reforming efforts, 1898 intellectuals opted for social change that would entail a wider embrace of foreign ideas and ideals; differing from iconoclastic modernizing ideologies and political visions of republican revolutionaries and the adherents of New Culture and May Fourth movements, the reformers active in the final years of the nineteenth century tried to enhance China’s international standing by reinterpreting and reinvigorating cultural and socio-political cannons and practices of China’s present and past. In their calling for gradual but systematic change of Chinese society, intellectual elites leading the Wuxu reforms considered the change of women’s position as necessary step towards China’s strengthening, thus providing the space for the entrance of Chinese women as both objects and subjects of the public debates and activities. My dissertation investigates the Wuxu reform movement through the prism of women’s direct participation in the debates and actions pointed to the improvement of China’s and Chinese women’s socio-political conditions. I analyze historically unprecedented emergence and operation of three women-oriented reformist projects – the association The Society for Women’s Learning (Nüxue hui), the journal Chinese Girls’ Progress (Nüxue bao) and the Girls’ School (Nüxue tang) - as a key for understanding the crucial role that gender has played within the processes of social changes in China in general, and within the reform movement of late-Qing period in particular. Despite the inherent historical uncertainties related to the authorship, I use Nüxue bao as the central source for an investigation of the ways in which women used the agendas of the Wuxu reforms to conceptualize and actualize historically unprecedented opportunities to organize and act as recognized legitimate socio-political actors. In the dissertation, I read the texts and actions ascribed to reform-oriented women within (neo)Confucian interpretative framework which informed socio-cultural and political discourses and practices of late-Qing elites. I argue that the process of formation of collective political identity of women and the discursive struggles over its past, present and future defining boundaries, content and meanings reveal the focal role that multiple destabilizations of the relationships between nei (inner) and wai (outer) spheres played in proposed and/or practiced social changes in late-Qing China. Focusing on Nüxue bao, my thesis will show that a redefinition of the relationships between nei and wai spheres, spatio-symbolic notions crucial for both gender roles and for cultural and socio-political ordering of the world defined by Imperial China, facilitated and got facilitated by women’s organizing, theorizing and acting for social change.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I argue that clubs were a milieu where clubbers could acquire dispositions of a new ‘progressive’ middle class. This class fraction corresponds to the global middle class of flexible workers in the creative economy who adapt well to neo-liberal capitalist structures in contemporary democracies. In the times when ‘traditional’ countercultures could no longer provide solutions, club cultures were a laboratory where clubbers could conceptualize and practice new (entrepreneurial) approaches to cultural organization and gain knowledge and skills transferable into ‘trendy’ jobs. Club cultures were also a mighty platform for assembling new consumer imaginary: clubbers were addressed as ‘party nation’ not just by the niche-specific media but also by, for instance, mobile phone operators or tobacco campaigns. Clubbers thus emerged as a value group of cosmopolitan orientation which imagined itself as ‘connected’ and harboring ‘good taste’. Such taste was perceived in contrast with the ‘mainstream’ and ‘disco-goers’ denoting gendered class. I further propose that gender/sexuality experiments conducted in clubs and conveyed by the imagery of related media were crucial for constituting the new economic subject. In this respect, I suggest the term neo-liberal sexual revolution as the gender/sexuality order promoted in clubs was closely attached to new ways of organizing culture and thinking about art and youth culture as inextricably related to the market.', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1504k)', 'Local note': 'Unrestricted'}"

My original contribution to knowledge is that my project expands scholarly debate on the HIV/AIDS epidemic towards the post-Soviet region, Ukraine in particular. In the dissertation, I suggested that the racialization of populations within a schema of medicalization and pathologization of discreet bodies and within discreet borders and territories, is a process that as much characterized European peripheries as it does non-European postcolonies. Given the central role of modern medicine in biopolitical governance, the HIV/AIDS epidemic serves as a useful tool for mapping certain kinds of processes that involve the networking, production and surveillance of bodies and borders, regimes of treatment, construction of population within and without borders, the production of social problems and discourses around them and attributing certain social problems to certain bodies, populations and spaces. Discourse analysis of international and Ukrainian state documents, reports and mass media sources on the epidemic in Ukraine urged me to (re)introduce the concept Race as an analytical tool for this dissertation. With a help of the concept I point to the fact that discourses on HIV/AIDS are involved in racializing post-Soviet states by producing difference through the alliance of medicine and politics. Relying on the Foucauldian concept of modern state racism, I address race as an all encompassing category, which points that at a given time and geopolitical space any other category (e.g. gender, sexuality, class, disability, age, state of homelessness etc.) or better to say the constellation of such categories, play out to justify/conceal the logic of transnational and/or state racism, involved in the production of inequality and domination, which perpetuate deterioration of life conditions and well-being among populations and spaces the most disproportionally affected by (global) power inequalities. In other words, race is a concept which translates social and political-economic inequalities into individual pathologies and inscribes them into marginalized body-subjects. In the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, on the one hand, racist discourses produce certain bodies, populations and spaces as naturally prone to the epidemic. On the other hand, they leave largely unquestioned (global) power inequalities which affect health, well-being and life chances making the populations, bodies and spaces vulnerable to the epidemic. Such discourses preserve the status quo of political interests, social, institutional and economic actors and processes invested in the epidemic throughout the world. In this dissertation I aim to question discourses involved in racializing certain bodies, populations and spaces as diseased and highlight relations of (global) power inequalities as both making those bodies, populations and spaces vulnerable to disease and concomitantly, marking them as pathological (often because underdeveloped) on the global geopolitical map.', 'File Type': 'Unrestricted', 'Access': 'PDF file (2325k)', 'System Det': 'PDF', 'Local note': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

It focuses on the socio-historical context of post-Yugoslav Croatia where the exclusionary treatment of sexual minorities represented the constitutive element in the process of nationalization in the 1990s, and where the rights of sexual minorities became an important part of the discourses of tolerance emerging in relation to the processes of democratization and European Union accession in 2000s. Placing the practices of self-identification in a social context where nominal sexual tolerance is present along with practices of stigmatization, violence, and discrimination, this research explores how sexually marginalized people negotiate the dominant nationalist discourses of belonging in and through the process of self-identification and self-understanding emerging in their life narratives. Drawing on postpositivist realist conception of identity as a product of dynamic interplay of the social and the personal, which opens up a space for individual agency, this project engages with the political relevance of (sexual) identity in relation to the struggles for social equality. It reveals that, in their life narratives, sexually marginalized people in Croatia develop different strategies of self-identification, some of which challenge nationalist notions of citizenship and belonging. These strategies can be identified as assimilation, queer disposition, and strategic positioning. Research also demonstrates important role that social positionality plays in shaping the emancipatory potential of (sexual) identity. By revealing that identity construction process may result in different degrees of reification and subversion of the dominant order, and possibly open up a space for non-exclusionary relations, this project questions the view of identities as inherently exclusionary and inevitably harmful for the emancipatory politics present in much of queer theory scholarship.', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1363k)', 'Local note': 'Unrestricted'}"

The research addresses questions about the timing, forms of and reasons for Polish Catholic laywomen’s activism to change women’s social, economic and political situation in both the private and public spheres. It explores what triggered the Catholic laywomen’s social engagement and who were the leaders, members and recipients of their various projects. The thesis investigates to whom the Catholic laywomen reached out for support and/or possible cooperation, as well as their overall recommendations with respect to altering women’s situation in the period. It studies whether their activities were part of Catholic laywomen’s movements/networks or were ad-hoc or stand-alone initiatives. It also explores instances of Catholic laywomen’s cooperation between the zones of Partitioned Poland and on the international level. Contrary to most available historical scholarship that suggests the early twentieth century as the dawn of modern Catholic laywomen’s social activism, by exploring the social projects of four female pioneers – Jadwiga Zamoyska, Antonina Machczyńska, Cecylia Plater-Zyberkówna and Maria Kleniewska – this thesis argues that Polish Catholic female laity of priviliged social backgrounds became socially active and began organizing themselves as early as the 1880s. Subsequently, I identify three major forms of social activism available to Polish pious women between the 1880s and 1918: in various pious women-launched and run individual social projects, within the framework of Church-founded and supervised pious associations, and in confessionally motivated nevertheless lay organizations that were supervised by female activists, but stayed in close touch with the Church hierarchy. My thesis argues that Polish Catholic laywomen’s social projects chiefly appeared at the crossroads of two broader phenomena: the woman question and New Catholicism. The woman question was informed by concern over the lack of educational opportunities for Polish women and later over their general socio-economic and political underprivileged position when compared with men, as raised by various parties (secular, religious, feminist, liberal) across the lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During the papacy of Leo XIII (1878-1903) New Catholicism’s emergence propelled the Church`s novel approach towards contemporary social issues. The employed tripartite historical perspective – the woman question and New Catholicism in the context of the Polish Partitions – enables me to uncover and analyze these women’s responsibilities and loyalties to three intertwined but competing projects: the improvement of women’s situation, the reestablishment of Catholicism in the public sphere, and the desire for an independent nation state. This thesis’s major contributions are, firstly, retrieving part of Polish Catholic women’s history and depicting them as historical actors engaged in various contemporary processes; secondly, reopening the discussion about the relation between Catholicism and the woman question; and thirdly, adding to the historical debates since the 1980s about the role of the religious and the secular in the modern period.

The primary question that the dissertation tries to answers is: which key historical, socio-economic, and political factors have hindered or facilitated the identification of domestic violence as a social problem requiring legal intervention in Georgia? My research methodology has comprised mainly of a desk review, subject-based interviews, and a small-scale survey of women’s NGOs in Georgia. The desk review included scholarly literature, studies and reports mainly related to domestic violence data and policymaking, women’s rights during the Soviet period and independent Georgia, Soviet-era periodicals, appeals, and manuscripts targeting women. I have studied NGO project documents on domestic violence as well as governmental and shadow reports submitted under the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Concluding Comments of the CEDAW Committee to Georgia. I have also reviewed Parliamentary debates around the draft Domestic Violence Law.  This dissertation makes three sets of related empirical and theoretical contributions. First, against the broader international human rights context, in which “violence against women” became recognized only in the 1990s, the thesis uncovers and discusses key factors that hindered or facilitated the identification of domestic violence at the time of the Soviet Union and in independent Georgia after 1991. For instance, the women’s liberation success story hindered recognition of the problem during the Soviet era. At the same time, the myth that the “Woman Question” had been resolved has outlived the Soviet Union and contributes to the low sensitivity of post-Soviet societies and governments to gender equality issues. The dissertation argues that many developments and experiences of the young independent Georgian state, such as armed conflicts and the emergence of an NGO sector, have been important factors contributing to the identification of domestic violence as a violation of women’s human rights in Georgia.  Second, I examine the process of the drafting of as well as the Georgian Domestic Violence Law itself and compare the findings of the Georgian case with related experiences of other countries. Despite the fact that the law was nurtured by the tragic experiences of women victims/survivors of domestic violence, the text of the law and the debates during its adoption process do not highlight the fact that domestic violence affects women disproportionately and that gendered power relations lie at the heart of domestic violence. Instead, the low sensitivity of the legislators and society at large to women’s rights and gender equality concerns is reflected in the de-gendered character of the Georgian Domestic Violence Law.  Third, I argue that each significant step (such as the adoption of legislation) towards social change is intrinsic and specific to the context from which or within which it emerges and can be understood only in relation to these context-specific factors.', 'File Type': 'Unrestricted', 'Access': 'PDF file (2237k)', 'System Det': 'PDF', 'Local note': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Turbo-folk has been the most popular music genre and the most developed music market in Serbia since the break-up of Yugoslavia to date, while the peak of its success was in the nineties during the period of rapid national homogenization in Serbia. The genre has often been criticized for political conformism and sexism promoted by its performances. In addition, it is often seen as an authentic expression of Serbian nationalist political aspirations, and “Serbian culture” which represents the existing social order and social values. Since the early nineties, the turbo-folk has promoted ethno-national community as the most relevant construct of the community in general. The thesis explores in what way the relationship between national identification and the representation of women has been constructed in turbo-folk performances. More to the point, it examines the interconnection between sexuality and gender dynamics represented in turbo-folk performances, on the one hand, and models of community and nation, on the other hand. In addition, the thesis explores in what way nationalism is produced in turbo-folk performances, and how representations of sexuality and gender dynamics are employed in the production of national homogeneity. The thesis analyzes the constructions of gender paradigms immanent to the concept of the ethno-national homogeneity. Central to these constructions are heteronormative representations of women as loyal to community values and sexually subject to the model of man, created on the basis of the socially privileged image of men in Serbian society.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Long hair was a sign of belonging to the royal family and a qualification for kingship; hence, cutting it off could be a temporary way of disqualifying a rival from political action. Some German historians of the late 19th and 20th centuries attempted to assign a sacral or magical quality to the Merovingian hair. Most such efforts suffered from severe methodological problems, in addition to being politically tainted by their authorsâ€™ association with National Socialism.

From the sociological theory on the function of consumption and the history of political movements, this thesis argues that the development of consumption in its early stage was influenced by the political decisions made by the Chinese Communist Party, and the further development of consumption gradually formulated a force to pushing the social transformation in China. By studying the case of “Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign”, I demonstrate that the development of consumption in China was once regarded as a potential threat to the ruling communist government. However, the party failed in stopping the process to establish a commodity economy in China, so they changed their strategies to balance the economic reform and the political reform. This work also attempts to evaluate the relationship between economic development and political liberalization in China’s reform era.

This thesis points to unsystematic ways in which the Russian empire used and not used symbolic narratives in its governance.

The underlying question of the research is why students decided to shift their social affiliation and embark upon the path of medical servants. The research will compare the Chancellery’s vision of recruitment as embodied in the legal framework it created and the challenges it faced when it came time to implement said laws. It shows social and cultural considerations which pushed students of different social backgrounds to choose a medical profession. It also traces the graduates’ careers and their involvement into the state service, the cultivation of a new identity of doctors and also looks at how they enforced their authority by opposing illegal healers.

Further to this, it analyzes the concepts of political ecology which formed part of the intellectual background of the environmental movements in Eastern Europe but which never came to the fore explicitly. This has important consequences beyond proving the obvious point that environmentalism did not mean the same thing on both sides of the Iron Curtain. Firstly, it points towards entanglements and negotiations between ecological critiques in these very different contexts. Secondly, it leads us to a better understanding of dissident politics in East- Central Europe in the period leading up to the regime change.

Instead, it should be read as a shifting platform of disparate concepts and traditions that converged for a short time to challenge the regime (but which subsequently went separate ways).

Using the main newspaper of the Yiddish anarchists, the Freie Arbeiter Stimme, I investigate two the effects of two events in particular: the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901 and the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination led to a wave of anti-anarchist sentiment and legislation that accelerated growing divisions within a mostly ambiguous Jewish radical movement made up of socialists and anarchists of all kind, atomizing different strains of radicals and leaving them more susceptible to ideological change. The Revolution of 1905 and its hundreds of pogroms brought that ideological change, shocking Jewish political movements everywhere and leading to the rapid growth of Jewish nationalism. Yiddish anarchists were some of the most fierce adherents of internationalism and the most estranged from Jewish politics, but they were nonetheless deeply affected by the shift and by nationalist discourse. The conjoined effects of the McKinley assassination and the 1905 Revolution were that Yiddish anarchism went from being a movement of Jews to a Jewish movement.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

During this period, a critical mass of intellectuals interacted with one another in close contact. These figures included, among others, Max and Marianne Weber, Edgar Jaffé and Else Jaffé-von Richtofen, Emil Lederer, Heinrich Rickert, Ernst Bloch, Georg von Lukács, Emil Lask, and Gustav Radbruch. Although this group came from numerous different intellectual contexts—e.g., neo-Kantian philosophy, antipositivistic sociology, romantic anti-capitalism—they each left their marks on one another, often publishing in the same journals, and most interacting with one another on the designated Sunday “jours” that the Webers’ held in their home on the Neckar. The house on Ziegelhäuser Landstraße 17 served as the physical center of this exchange—a central, scenic meeting place for salon-type activity. The investigation draws upon a wealth of theoretical tools—Karl Mannheim’s “sociology of the intelligentsia,” Reinhart Koselleck’s distinction between “space of experience” and “horizon of expectation,” as well as Goethe’s rendering of “elective affinity”—in order to characterize the interactions of the Weber Circle. This thesis asks how it could be the case that intellectuals so tightly bound together on personal and intellectual terms could split apart so radically in the wake of the First World War. In order to dive into this distinction, I use Koselleck’s heuristic use of “crisis” to organize two reactions to the war: Emil Lask’s enlistment and Georg von Lukács’ resentment. What emerges is a composite picture of an intellectual circle that, when faced with a moment of world-historical crisis, fractured along pre-defined lines of stress. This thesis asserts that moments of historical crisis reconstitute previously “secure” elective affinities between intellectuals due to their status as intellectuals: thus, one must look at intellectual contexts, local situations, and macro-historical events in the same perspective.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I focus on how the different aspects—theatrical, carnivalesque, and ritual—of Purim theatre were harmonized and how they interacted with each other. In order to recover the performative character of this singular cultural phenomenon and to flesh out its three main facets, I primarily rely on a Bakhtinian close reading of the first three Sephardi comedias burlescas that remained from the end of the seventeenth century: El perseguido dichoso, Comedia famosa de Aman y Mordochay, and Comedia famosa dos successos de Jahacob e Essau. This study demonstrates that their Catholic cultural background allowed Jews to adopt Iberian dramatic forms with relative ease, to recreate them according to their own interests, and finally to develop a semi-professional, more or less institutionalized theatrical structure in the midst of the Jewish carnival. The festive spirit and upside-down character of the carnival provided the perfect platform for theatre to emerge in a culture that generally condemned theatrical practice. Additionally, I argue that these comedias had a complex and fruitful relation to Purim rituals which they often evoked, imitated, and parodied, and which promoted the reinforcement of collective identity and communal cohesion. Ultimately, I reveal that the cultivation of this genre can be interpreted as an early sign of modernization and acculturation of the Sephardim of early modern Amsterdam.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

An understanding of this conflict is crucial for completing the picture of the evolution of the KPJ in the interwar period, and its relationship to the Communist International, as well as for reevaluating the roots of the Tito-Stalin Split. The research sheds new light on the process of appointing a general secretary in the midst of the Great Purge, whilst also offering an alternative understanding of the relations between the Comintern and its constituent parties. In spite of the frequently repeated assumption that the KPJ was an insignificant satellite of the Comintern, completely subjected to the decisions of its Executive Committee, the argument of this work is that the Yugoslav communists still enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. Their Moscow superiors were far from detached, but they encouraged and expected independent actions. Tito was the candidate who understood this expectation the best, which gave him a crucial advantage in the factional struggle. Moreover, the struggle involved communists from many other communist parties, showing how political networks of the Comintern often transcended national ties, and reminding us that the history of national sections of the Third International can never be observed in a vacuum. The research begins by tracing the rise and fall of Milan Gorkić, the de facto leader of the KPJ from 1932 until 1937. The clash between him and his opponents, who accused him of “rightist deviation” at the April Plenum in 1936, drew the attention of the Comintern, which saw the conflict as a revival of factionalism. The following year saw the purging of the former oppositionists within the KPJ, mostly Trotskyists. Gorkić soon became a victim of the Great Purge as well, sparking an all-out struggle for leadership over the party. The main contenders for the vacant position of the general secretary were Josip Broz Tito, whose group was dubbed the Temporary Leadership; Ivo Marić and Labud Kusovac, who led the so-called Parallel Center; Petko Miletić, the leader of an ultra-left group called the Wahhabis; and Kamilo Horvatin, the KPJ representative to the Comintern. After over two and a half years of conflict, Tito emerged as the new general secretary.  The KPJ was, by and large, a party on the left of the international communist movement. All of the main leadership candidates were leftists, which was not ideal in the period of the popular front, when the Communist International required moderation and cooperation. Tito prevailed over other candidates primarily because of a proper understanding of Leninism as defined by the Comintern at the time, and the practical achievements in reviving the party organization in the country. As a consequence of the purge, the factional struggle, and the practical political experiences of the newly-formed leadership, the period between 1936 and 1940 became the key formative period, playing a crucial role in the making of the KPJ as we know it from the 1940s on. Thus, the story of the KPJ leadership struggle in the late 1930s is, in a lot of ways, a prehistory of 1948.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Examining two cases, I explore the themes of remembrance, cultural reconstruction and art restitution in regard to Polish and Polish-Jewish culture in the immediate post-war period. The analysis of exhibitions has two main layers. Firstly, I analyze their social and political context. Secondly, I focus on the social biographies of displayed artworks to reveal how different meanings were ascribed to them after the war, and the ways in which they were reinterpreted. I identify two methods of art restitution—one carried out “from above” by the state institutions, and one “from below” by the Jewish organization—to argue that after the war the urge to preserve the past became a crucial issue not only in relation to lost human beings, but also material heritage. My object-oriented approach reveals ways in which the Polish and Polish-Jewish culture was reconstructed and perpetuated between 1945 and 1949. I show how the discussed displays of “rescued” artworks, which I consider the prototypes of restitution exhibitions, were expressions of the post-war construction of collective victimhood. My analysis shows the important place of national culture in post-war Poland and traces the attempts to reconstruct Jewish culture and to create a new Jewish identity in the ethnically homogeneous communist state.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The study of Islamic eschatology gained momentum in the last three decades of the 20th century that was brought about by a shift of scholars’ attention to non-canonical sources. During this upsurge of scholarly works about Islamic eschatology the particular figure, an expected ruler of Yemenite lineage, received less attention than some other eschatological figures, such as the ubiquitous Mahdī and Sufyānī. However, this is one of the few eschatological figures who appears in some of most central texts of Sunni Islam. The vision of a future Yemenite ruler also appears in wide array of literary, historical, encyclopaedic, and religious works. However, scholars may have not exploited this plurality to its fullest potential so far and have rarely compared the multiplicity of forms in which predictions about this figure were represented in roughly the same period. This characteristic of the earlier scholarship necessitated a synthetic approach to the subject; hence I combine the examination of various original sources with the findings of secondary literature on them. Through this synthetic approach, I aim to present a coherent picture about the variations and modalities by which expectations about this figure were formulated. I examine three types of sources in this work. I discuss historico-legendary books on Ancient South Arabia, historical and encyclopaedic texts mentioning Umayyad age rebels, and the historico-mantic segments of collections containing Islamic eschatological lore. My general aim is to uncover the variety readings of this figure and the notions associated with him. These readings and associated notions do not always warrant the understanding of this figure as messianic. Instead, two chief tasks were expected to be executed by this figure. First, he was expected to return the hegemony the pre-Islamic South Arabians over the world– a widespread notion among Muslims and Arabs in the first Islamic centuries. Second, he was also a token of the eventual end of the rule of the Qurayš – the tribe of the Prophet Muḥammmad.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

By focusing on the formation of administrative practices that enabled more and more detailed and comprehensive record keeping about the capacities of individual monks and nuns, I investigate the impact of Maria Theresa’s and Joseph II’s church policies both on the Habsburg imperial and the Catholic ecclesiastical governmental structures. I explore how they succeeded in or fell short of creating a “rank and file” personnel of the church that could (have been) able to put into practice their vision of a “well-ordered” state and church, and, ultimately, of a well-governed society. Instead of marking the starting point of imperial uniformity with largely identical legal texts issued on the same day or with minor delay in the central lands by Joseph II, I emphasize the synchronicity of developing bureaucratic structures in the various Habsburg domains from the 1750s, when both the blueprints of discursive patterns and administrative structures started taking shape on an imperial scale. I consider the church policies as a complex program consisting of various points to be achieved among which always the most feasible elements were put forward among the limits of the local legal framework, administrative infrastructure and economic basis. This perspective opens up new ways of considering the place of the Hungarian Kingdom among the Habsburg realms. It was the preparation of the law of amortization from 1750 – and the design of its later amendments – that first considered individuals as economic factors: while it intended to put a halt on the accumulation of mortmain properties, it also recognized the act of taking monastic vows as an occasion when a “dowry” or expected heritage was offered to the convent from which the expenses of the sustenance of the new member could be covered fully or partially for a lifetime. By the end of the 1760s, the costs and potential benefits of sustaining individual monks and nuns became the subject of extensive inquiries and both ecclesiastical and secular authorities were instructed to submit detailed reports according to predesigned questionnaires. Thus, the preconditions of preparing policies on the basis of previously gathered information were established and the main characteristics of the “monastic landscape” had been explored. They also revealed a specific feature of the of the Hungarian Kingdom: it was dominated by mendicant orders. Consequently, the “resource potential” of the monasteries lay not so much in their goods, but in their inhabitants whose utilization for pastoral care was a clearly explicated principle. By focusing the reports of a widening network of experts and officials, I demonstrate that the period after 1786 can be characterized rather with the intensification of the control over monasteries as new governmental and record keeping techniques made individuals visible for the state in great detail.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1773k)'}"

Fundamentally, this thesis explores the interaction between migration policy and the migration strategies of those Displaced Persons (DPs) who populated the DP camp universe of Occupied Germany from 1945-1950. It demonstrates in particular how the policies of the British Zone impacted DPs’ itineraries after 1945 and aims to highlight the structural factors that constrained the lives of postwar displaced persons, while examining the ways in which DPs own migratory strategies adapted to, negotiated and even challenged those constraints. At the DP level, this thesis systematically compares the migratory experiences of Polish and Jewish DP communities. It examines how both communities made sense of displacement after 1945 and the ways in which DP nationalism may be said to have guided different DP communities’ decision-making with respect to migration. As much as ethno-national distinctions gained currency in the DP camps, Polish and Jewish DP communities hardly constituted a unified or coherent group. Importantly, the systematic ethno-national comparison between Polish and Jewish communities offered in this study is also tested against the individual account. Particularly where resettlement abroad was considered, it is this project’s contention that alternative identifications gained primacy and, to some extent, challenged notions of solidarity as DPs looked forward. As much as the experience of displacement is shaped by diverse structures, including—but not limited to—social class, gender, age and religion, so too were the imagined and realized visions of the future outside the displaced persons camps. Of central concern, therefore, is where it was, exactly, that DP individuals saw their futures, if anywhere, and how these visions were affected and adapted. The flesh of this study are the Care and Maintenance Files (CM/1 Forms) of individual DPs, accessible through the records of the International Tracing Service (ITS) archive. Although official in setting, ITS records go a long way to evidencing evolving DP strategizing with respect to migration and are at the heart of this research as a body of sources not yet actively engaged with in scholarship on migration out of Displaced Persons camps. While the past few decades have seen a steady stream of scholarship devoted to DPs in the aftermath of the Second World War, there is today a new wave of interest in chronicling the voices of the agencies and governments who came into contact with them and in particular, of the DPs themselves. In its exploration of the relationship between formalized collective pressure and individual migratory considerations, and its juxtaposition of the individual and the collective, this research offers a fresh analysis of the migratory experiences of Displaced Persons after the Second World War and what this can reveal about displacement more generally. While the life of the refugee was constrained by very real structural factors, displaced subjects with specific experiences sought to modify their circumstances by making choices and acting upon them.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

New ideas and practices of observing, analyzing, and intervening in the social realities of socialist society emerged beginning in the early 1960s, originally in debates over the canonical disciplines of Marxist-Leninist social science (historical materialism, scientific socialism, and Marxist sociology). These were further developed by Marxist revisionist and humanist Marxist thought on the relationship between individuals and society in socialism, which decentered the collectivist ethos characteristic of “dogmatic” Marxism-Leninist philosophy for most of the 1950s. Made possible by the Marxist humanist breakthrough of the early 1960s, Marxist-Leninist sociology was subsequently established as a separate discipline at the Academy of Social and Political Sciences and at the University of Bucharest. Institutional and intellectual constraints and possibilities were differently configured in these two contexts. For the case of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences, the dissertation emphasizes the dynamic between local, transnational, and global frameworks of knowledge production, and the role of Eastern bloc cooperation in the field of sociology in particular. In the Romanian context, the interplay between local and transnational frames of reference resulted in studies of the social structure of socialist society that sought to rework concepts of everyday Marxism-Leninism—as formulated in party pronouncements and translated into the planning of knowledge production in the social sciences. The most notable among these was the concept of “social homogenization.” Developed since the second half of the 1960s, through to the qualitative turn of the late 1970s, and into the 1980s, its history illustrates the interplay between legitimization and criticism characteristic of Marxist-Leninist sociology.  Several student cohorts were trained at the University of Bucharest between 1965, when the sociology department was first established, through to 1977, when the department was disbanded, and in a very restricted sense until the end of the 1980s. As taught at the university, sociology drew on Marxist, interwar, and Western sociological sources. This idiosyncratic intellectual blend underpinned large-scale empirical research on the two main sociological issues of social development (especially in relation to industrialization and urbanization) and scientific management (in relation to social planning). By outlining the context of sociology as practiced at the university alongside oral history accounts by sociology students trained at the time, generational, intellectual, and existential fault lines come to the fore beneath a commonly shared understanding of sociology as an apolitical science of “social engineering” with roots in the interwar period.  The second part of the dissertation proposes a “reverse genealogy” of three themes which became part of the imaginary of postsocialist intellectual thought on the social: participation, equality, and welfare. It explores how the three intellectual, institutional, and generational contexts identified in the first part of the dissertation played out in sociological research on mass culture, women’s emancipation, and the quality of life in the 1960s–80s.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

Providing an interpretative framework for the analysis of both contemporary politics of elite-actors and socioeconomic development in the period, the thesis demonstrates that this approach is best suited to address a number of deficiencies in the historiography of the Monarchy. Within this framework, the thesis also contributes to closing an empirical gap in the scholarship that has examined the transition to capitalism by providing an analysis of the discourse of political economy in Croatia, Hungary and Austria. The thesis argues the Hungarian gentry, despite a lower level of development that characterized the country when compared to Austria, was ready to initiate the transition to capitalism in response to its social decline and the geopolitical challenge posed by Austria that was undergoing industrialization. In the process, the gentry relied on ready made ideologies and organizations from social formations on a higher level of development. The specificity of the Hungarian social formation and not its position in the world-system is considered a key factor for explaining strong state structures in Hungary in the period under examination. By contrast, the centralized, authoritarian Austrian state could not mobilize social forces into a more hegemonic project after the revolutions of 1848. The political elites of Croatia and Hungary rejected the Austrian developmentalist and civilizing discourse because the Austrian state was deemed both incapable of developing the peripheries and too authoritarian. Systemic conditions further exacerbated the difficult position of the Austrian state, as changes in international relations left it exposed to considerable strain. The thesis thus explains the emergence of Austro-Hungarian Settlement as a result of the Hungarian revolution, state-society relations in Austria and changes in international relations. With regard to divergence in socioeconomic development in the Monarchy before 1848, the thesis considers social property relations rather than Austrian tariffs as crucial for generating the economic stagnation of the Croatian and Hungarian social formations. While explaining why the gentry in Hungary was ready to initiate the transition to capitalism, the thesis maintains that Croatia did not have an endogenously driven transition to capitalism despite similarities in social structures with Hungary due to a smaller territorial container. The thesis considers post-1848 economic stagnation in Croatia as caused by the legacy of centuries of extra-economic coercion, uneven development under capitalism, the centralized regime of accumulation in the Austrian Empire and an upswing in the world-economy that did not favor a relocation of economic activities. It maintains that a relatively meager development of Croatia after 1848 cannot be explained with reference to feudal dispositions of the landlords. The thesis claims that the Hungaro-Croatian Settlement, rather than being caused by the Croatian class structure, was more geopolitically determined.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2793k)'}"

It presents the development of scientific circles, institutions, and practices on the European periphery and analyses the power dynamics that stood behind them. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Serbia was an Ottoman province that was striving to become an independent nation state, in which it ultimately succeeded in 1878. Science was in Serbia intrinsically dependent on the process of state-building and the formation of state elites, in which scholars became the carriers of the process of the transformation of society. The formation of scientific circles, their recognition in Serbian society, and the establishment of institutional, educational, and research practices depended on their successful embeddedness in the contemporary political, intellectual, and social networks. This study exemplifies how notions of expertise and epistemic fields were constructed in the earth sciences, and how scholars divided research and responsibilities among themselves. Through the examination of personal notes, diaries, correspondence, and scientific publications, I have identified the power dynamics and strategies that led some of them to achieve the status of experts, recognised as such either by their colleagues, or by the state administration. In this respect, I have given special attention to the role that state and politics had on the dynamics of these circles, as well as to the role international scientific networks played in the recognition of their expertise. Particular focus is given to the careers of Jovan Žujović and Jovan Cvijić, who established scientific circles around them. Žujović became the primary organiser of scientific research in mineralogy, petrography, geology, palaeontology, and seismology by mobilising his students to study abroad and conduct research in earth sciences. The expansion of the circle led to the creation and division of separate scientific sub-disciplines in which scholars established their expertise. Through the interaction with international scientific networks, these scholars were looking for recognition and affirmation of Belgrade as a new international scientific centre. In this endeavour, Jovan Cvijić turned out to be the most successful. Because of his pragmatically chosen topics, he managed to distinguish himself both internationally and in Serbian public opinion. Both Žujović and Cvijić managed to assert themselves as the founding figures of Serbian science, yet that role depended on their social and political capital as much as it did on their academic capital. Science was strongly embedded in social and political processes and its development was conditioned by successful interaction across multiple social networks.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

It raises the question, how did the mindset, habitus, and ideology of private clerks become constitutive of the changes the modernizing society and economy of the Habsburg Monarchy went through in this period, and how can their understanding of modernity be contrasted to other answers offered to the “great transformation” of the nineteenth century. The dissertation relies on three clusters of theoretical and historiographical ideas to address Habsburg modernity from the perspective of private clerks: the conceptualization of capitalist modernity by Werner Sombart and Max Weber; the rise of numbers and the historical development of credibility in quantification; and the presupposition of a common Habsburg framework for the social and intellectual history of private clerks. Through the lens of this conceptual framework, the dissertation can bypass the shortcomings of modernization theories and the normativity of descriptions like “failed,” “uneven,” and “belated” modernization to produce a comprehensive account of the “great transformation” in Central Europe in its larger contexts. The development of financial capitalism in the Habsburg Monarchy produced its own cadre of professionals in the form of bookkeepers, correspondents, cashiers, and so forth. The need for specialized workforce brought about the emergence of vocational schooling on the secondary level beginning in the late 1850s. Their labor movements sought to improve the legal and financial situation of private employees; this involved the creation of firm social frontiers between the working classes and private clerks as well as the affirmation of their belonging to the Bildungsbürgertum. The activities of private clerk associations were closely entangled with the development of state interventionism that was often equally sought for and disapproved of by the social group. Efforts at class formation challenged the capacity of the state to enforce civil and political rights against the power of economic elites. Social categories like nationality and gender intersected the development of the social group. Language differences were differently approached by dominant and minority ethnic groups in both halves of the Habsburg Monarchy. The numerical growth of female private clerks after the turn of the century coincided with their increasing discrimination on multiple levels. Women were systematically discriminated in the educational system and entered the job market with a considerable disadvantage compared to men. Discrimination against women was equally practiced by employers and employee associations. Lastly, the experts and professionals that populate the universe of this thesis often turned to quantification and used “mechanical objectivity” to gain public credibility. In debates over old-age pensions, mathematicians were forced to share the “secret of actuarial calculations” with the public to gain credibility. Trust in numbers, though, was not the only way to create public credibility in capitalist endeavors.

After a conceptual and historiographic introduction in the first chapter embedding this work in the contexts of Jewish studies, social history and exile studies; interwar Hungarian Jewish peregrination is examined from four different aspects in four chapters based on four different types of sources. In the second chapter an analysis of contemporary Hungarian (Jewish and non-Jewish) discourses is based on pro-Horthy, Conservative, Liberal, Social Democratic, assimilationist Jewish and Zionist press. It is argued that peregrination from Hungary was in the general press recognized as a mostly Jewish phenomenon, caused by the restriction of Jewish access to Hungarian universities, rather than a voluntary movement motivated by thirst for knowledge. In the meantime, the plight of émigré students became a central topic in Jewish press because a new Hungarian Jewish community of fate and identity was built on the support mechanism for numerus clausus exiles. Based on a database of over 1000 Hungarian medical and engineering students enrolled in universities abroad between 1920 and 1938 – Czechoslovakia, the First Austrian Republic, Weimar Germany and Fascist Italy – that the dissertation’s author constructed; the third chapter analyzes the social background of émigré students – most of whom were Jewish. In this way the case is made that studying abroad was a phenomenon of lower middleclass Jewish youth’s upward social mobility through education rather than an escape route reserved for privileged Jews. Ego documents written and edited (in most cases even published) by numerus clausus exiles provide the source base for the fourth chapter which reconstructs their own narratives on their peregrination. The prevalence of interpreting their student migration as exile from the Hungarian homeland unfolds both from autobiographies and memoirs written decades later and from letters sent while studying abroad, albeit with important individual variations. Based on digital databases, the fifth chapter follows up the career and life trajectories of students after their studies abroad. Four basic patterns are distinguished among the biographies of the over 1000 subjects: the most successful ones emigrated to the Western world usually through step-migration through Weimar Germany and did not return to Hungary. Few numerus clausus exiles immigrated to Palestine, however, they played important roles in the higher education and scholarship of Mandate Palestine and later of the State of Israel. Most numerus clausus exiles were forced to return to Hungary in the late 1930s due to the spread of hostility towards foreign Jews across Europe. They belong to two main groups, namely Shoah victims and Shoah survivors. The latter were likely to stay in Hungary for the rest of their lives after liberation, their experience with emigration notwithstanding, because they received opportunities for career advancement earlier denied to them and many believed this was also a chance to redeem Hungary from inequalities and injustices through Socialism. At the same time, quite a few numerus clausus exiles were put on show trials in the Stalinist period due to their past abroad and many more got disillusioned by the discrepancies between the ideal of Communism and the reality of State Socialism. Finally, it is argued in the final conclusions that this study speaks to the larger questions of how a minority can respond to discrimination and how individual initiatives from below can develop into communal agency based on solidarity.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

In Poland, for more than a decade activists, in numbers increasing from hundreds to tens of thousands, would meet, in secrecy, using codenames and passwords, to edit, print and distribute books and periodicals on every subject and catering to all tastes, building extensive networks of horizontal communication sustained by voluntary involvement and accessible technologies, the existence of which was of vital importance at critical turning points in history of the democratic opposition under late socialism. An iconic manifestation of civic disobedience, Polish dissident media activism as a cultural, intellectual and political phenomenon should not be reduced, however, to its instrumental purpose of overcoming state surveillance of ideas and their flow. Unlicensed publishing brought together actors, their practices and ideas, with technologies and things, to form a complex web, which was both a horizontal communication network that sustained the flow of dissident ideas, and the corresponding web of meanings. Within that broad web of meanings articulated around social media practices, this study explores the political instances of meaning-making, representing an approach which fuses insights from the second wave of samizdat studies, media history, and intellectual history of dissident political thought. Proposing an alternative to narratives organized around the Cold War conceptual polarities, but without surrendering to a de-politicized cultural history perspective, this study puts in the spotlight the correspondence between a certain set of political ideas and beliefs, and a certain form of media practices. Networks of unlicensed social media gave shape and meaning to the prefigurative variant of the dissident political philosophy, resting on the conviction that organizational forms a collective action employs to achieve social and political change predetermine, or ‘prefigure,’ the kind of polity it aims at instituting. The prefigurative principle provided the framework in which the unlicensed social media activists made sense of what they were doing as a form of practicing democracy. It was a way of affirming that small collective forms of democratic agency are possible even under repressive conditions, as well as asserting their transformative effect on public life. But also conversely, for the oppositional political thinkers, the unlicensed print culture gave the prefigurative idea a strong resonance in the lived experience. If the vision of prefigurative democracy permeated the imaginary of dissident social media activism, it was not always the guiding philosophy of action of the broader oppositional movement. Thus, while a significant purpose of this work is to examine the distinctive features of the unlicensed social media politics, another, no less important aim is to understand its place and significance in the broader intellectual history of oppositional politics in Poland.

It scrutinizes the political trajectories and ideological transformations of political parties in the interwar Czech lands, Austria and Slovene part of Yugoslavia, that are treated under the joint term “national liberal heirs.” The parties under scrutiny are the Czechoslovak National Democracy (Československá národní demokracie), the Austrian Greater German People's Party (Grossdeutsche Volkspartei) and the Slovene sections of the Yugoslav Democratic (Jugoslovanska demokratska stranka), Independent Democratic (Samostojna demokratska stranka) and Yugoslav National Parties (Jugoslovanska nacionalna stranka). These parties all inherited the national liberal tradition in terms of organization, social base, their rootedness in specific milieus and belonging to specific political “camps”. Their genealogically liberal background, however, did not necessarily imply commitment to the national liberal ideology of their predecessors or conscious identification with liberalism, which they often explicitly rejected. The basic aim is setting up a common horizon for studying the discussed type of political party. Most importantly the dissertation discusses the degrees and types of nationalism espoused by the observed parties, their socio-economic views and paragons, their cultural politics and the relationships toward liberal democracy on one and alternative political models on the other side. By addressing these problems, it shows how national liberal party traditions continued moving along their pre-WWI trajectory that had been leading towards radicalization of the nationalist component at the expense of the liberal one. Lacking clear ideological fundaments, facing disorientation, coupled by eroding social bases, the parties under scrutiny were furthermore particularly susceptible to flirtation with new ideological currents, some of them radically illiberal, and adoption of some of their discursive elements. Generally, they however remained within the frame of representative democratic order. The disorientation also reflected in the attempts to (re-)define their positions as nationalist, conservative or – as it was most often the case - vaguely defined “democratic” parties. In its concluding chapter the dissertation also tackles the various meanings associated with the term “liberalism” in political languages of the studied contexts, as these reflected in the contemporary debates.

The attempts of the government to construct wide and straight streets on a grid system were not only a matter of new urban aesthetics but also a process of value creation in the built environment. Giving a new order to the city was also an attempt to change the relational values of urban property. To moderate such a process and mediate spatial value relations was not easy; therefore, the government had to fashion a fiction of urban rent in which city dwellers could position their interests as property owners. It is this fiction of urban rent within which this study presents property as a social relation in which politics of location and value were played out around concepts like şeref that had both moral and economic meanings. This dissertation explores moments of contestation, persuasion, ambiguity, opposition, corruption as well as compliance in the space of the ‘modern’ – the street – where property owners fashioned competing notions of justice and morality in the collective and social production of urban tanzîmât.

In this sense, coping with the far-reaching consequences of the war as they affected various domains of social life while building socialism constituted entangled processes of postwar transformation. How did these regimes manage to end the postwar by overcoming the domestic impact of the Second World War? Taking Romania as a case-study and industrial workers in metal industries and mining as objects of analysis, this dissertation argues that in the realm of labour relations the major paradigm for ending the postwar was the “politics of productivity”: a complex, always conflicting set of policies, plans and strategies designed to recover the efficiency of industrial production and gear it towards stable, long-term growth. The politics of productivity, I contend, structured the transition from the period of postwar reconstruction to the take-off of industrial development during the late 1950s, thus mediating the transformation of the war economy bequeathed by the Second World War into a socialist command economy tailored to national circumstances. Conceived as (1) pacification of labour relations, (2) the recovery of managerial authority, (3) monetarization of everyday life, (4) rationalization and (5) austerity, the politics of productivity provides a comprehensive conceptual framework for grasping together the end of the postwar period and the building of state socialism in Eastern Europe. By revealing how the social consequences of the Second World War were absorbed in the transition to authoritarian state socialism in the age of the rolling steel mill, this dissertation carries implications for the way in which we may think about the aftermath of wars, reconstruction and development during the second half of the twentieth century.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (5525k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The argument challenges a common view that largely defined heritage policies in the Romanian context in terms of neglect and extensive destruction, and proposes instead to look at the construction and use of the historical built environment as an economic, political and cultural resource. It states that, despite the ideology of radical urban transformation, preservation did play a role in the process of reshaping urban landscapes under socialism, which is visible in the fragmented character of urban modernization policies, as well as in the resulting cityscapes. The topic of demolition and reconstruction is approached as part of strategies of economic development and urban planning, paying attention at the changing conceptual, institutional, and legal frameworks. The study contributes to the literature on urban modernization during the postwar decades, emphasizing the peculiarities of the Romanian socialist project as an ideologically-based strategy of development. Centrally-devised economic policies prescribed a moderate pace of urban growth in the first two postwar decades, to shift to intensive industrialization and urbanization in the 1970s. These stages coincided with the rise and fall of modernism, which was replaced by the imposition of a more compact urban model, stressing higher building densities. The ideological vision of radical reconstruction was challenged (and constrained) by two types of preservationist agendas. Firstly, the Bucharest-based Department for Historic Monuments re-conceptualized the value of built heritage, stressing especially in the 1970s the need to preserve and incorporate portions of the old town into projects of urban modernization. However, despite the efforts of dedicated professionals, the Department’s activity was negatively affected by internal frictions and a limited understanding of its scope. As a result, it failed to develop a stronger institutional and legal basis, which would have allowed its experts to negotiate from a position of stronger authority with political decision-makers. Secondly, confronted with economic constraints and the scarcity of resources, decision-makers themselves elaborated an alternative “preservationist” agenda, stressing the need of saving on urban land, infrastructure and even old buildings. In the 1960s and the early 1970s, Ceauşescu personally criticized demolition as a waste of resources. The second part of the thesis focuses on two case studies – the cities of Cluj and Iași – in order to argue for the importance of local legacies and visions in shaping the socialist project. If Transylvanian towns were perceived as having a compact medieval core worthy of preservation, in Moldavia and Wallachia the historicity of the old town was less legible in the inherited built fabric, and only individual monuments were singled out as heritage. The smaller case studies discussed in these chapters show how concepts regarding the specific character of the town were defined, challenged, and re-defined as part of urban redevelopment projects. At the local level, the creation of new regimes of spatial and social order depended on the extent to which various actors could manipulate the infrastructure of a system that was simultaneously rigid and porous. It concludes that, despite the rhetoric of grand schemes of action, the approaches to urban redevelopment have been rather local and contextual.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'DOI: 10.14754/CEU.2017.04'}"

Arguably the most important war crimes trial held in postwar Romania, the criminal prosecution of Marshal Ion Antonescu (1882- 1946) and twenty-three of his former political and military collaborators attracted considerable media attention due to the high profile of the defendants (former members in the wartime Antonescu cabinets) and the severity of their offenses (‘war crimes’ and ‘contribution to the country’s disaster’), while the partiality and expediency that accompanied the court proceedings generated even greater controversy. Starting from the premise that the ad-hoc Bucharest People’s Court that heard the case deliberately deviated from the established legal norms and judicial procedures, this dissertation intends to demonstrate that this particular trial exceeded its original retributive purpose and became inextricably entangled in the early Cold War rivalries between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies, on the one hand, and the local struggle for power between the rising Romanian Communist Party and the traditional political forces opposing a Communist takeover, on the other. More concretely, the Soviet Union and its local protégée, the Communist-dominated Groza government, exceeded their prerogatives and turned this trial into a medium to advance their political and propagandistic objectives, namely the vilification of the Communist political rivals as ‘fascists’ and ‘collaborators’, the glorification of the alleged leading role played by the local Communists in the wartime ‘anti-fascist struggle’ or the coup of August 23, 1944, as well as the harnessing of popular support for the forthcoming local parliamentary elections. The end result of this partisan interference was the transformation of the trial of the Antonescu group into a glaring example of ‘political justice’.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2458k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Hungary’s loss of the First World War was the original impetus for the competition to rewrite a history that also rewrites borders between states, often producing a less plausible version of history, but also for a broadened interest in the shared history and culture of the region, and a better basis for historical research. The dissertation puts forward a thesis of a transformation of historical studies on the neighboring countries that follows a path (1) from being propagandistic nature in the immediate aftermath of the First World War, (2) to eventually a more political history oriented research of the nationalities (minorities) of Hungary before 1918 in order to explain the demise of Hungary, (3) to histories of the neighboring countries themselves, and (4) finally to full-scale comparative histories of Hungary and the neighboring nations, i.e., regional comparative history. These final two stages, which of course did not eliminate entirely the first two, depended on the rise of a group of historians who could learn the languages and research the history of nations neighboring Hungary. This in itself was a difficult task since historians in Hungary previously looked to Germany, France, and the West as foundations of historical comparison rather than the smaller surrounding nations and regions, which also entailed learning the languages of nations that in the interwar era were considered hostile to Hungary. There was a fairly large cohort of young historians, linguists, philologists, and literary historians engaged in this task. Out of this larger group, however, the dissertation focuses on seven who best exemplify the skills needed to engage in regional comparative history, and who had a large enough oeuvre (including monographs) before 1945 in order for this dissertation also to have a basis for evaluation. They are László Makkai, Lajos Tamás, Zoltán I. Tóth, László Gáldi, Domokos Kosáry, Lajos Gogolák, and László Hadrovics. These seven are called the “comparatists” because they consciously engaged in the writing of comparative works and based their studies on what they perceived to be the more advanced methods of the historical sciences of the interwar era. This dissertation shows how comparative history writing in Hungary was syncretic in nature and could be combined with different dominant and minor historiographical schools of the interwar era, a factor which explains its successes and appeal. It explores how robust university departments in Hungary of Romanian and Slavic literatures and training in modern linguistics aided the project of historical comparison. It delves into the nexus of politics, nationalism, and history writing; how nationalism colors the research agenda of historians, and how competition among regional actors set conceptual frameworks. The thesis concludes that in spite of the challenges to impartial history writing in this era, a concerted effort to study the history of the neighboring nations and broader region was not wasted. And though comparative history writing came to an abrupt end, partly during which a majority of the comparatists were marginalized, in many ways it created the foundation for future studies on the region, which however were conceptually framed in Marxist theory. The dissertation thus aims to uncover a broader story of comparative history writing in Hungary that so far has only been told sporadically and is usually hidden under the better-known historiographical debates of the interwar era. Here the order is reversed, and comparative history writing is set up as its own subject which can then reflect back on the historiographical debates of the time.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2648k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Empirically, this study contributes towards a wider understanding of fascism in Central and Southeastern Europe, especially with regard to the youth organizations which emerged during the interwar and Second World War periods. The main hypothesis presented is that the Ustasha Youth organization, the key variable within the Ustasha regime, was deemed crucial for setting in motion the Ustasha idea of an all-embracing, totalitarian revolution whose main goal was to create a new national community composed of ‘new’ Croats – the Ustashas. Led by their charismatic Poglavnik, Ante Pavelić, the Ustashas embarked on a totalitarian experiment of creating a new state and a new individual devoted to the Poglavnik, as the embodiment of this state and nation. Their ‘new’ state and society were envisioned as a strong national community, where the individual matters only as much as he/she devotes himself/herself to the cause and benefit of the community. Once set in motion, this revolution consisted of two interconnected, mutually depended practices: prosecution, mass murder, and Holocaust, all legalized within a month of the regime’s existence, and the youth regimentation and reeducation. The Ustasha Youth organization was tasked with providing the youth with new education, with a new worldview, so as to create the ideal ‘new’ Croat – the Ustasha. Education, sport, manual work, camping, separately established Ustasha schools, and transnational connections with other fascist youth organizations all had the purpose of immersing the youth into this ‘new reality’, as presented by the Ustashas. Through all this the youth was to learn what it meant to be the ‘real’ Croat – the Ustasha, who was to become an active participant in this emerging ‘new’, fascist Europe. Despite swift organizational success, within a year of its establishment the Ustasha Youth organization’s ideas and practices were hindered by serious organizational and political problems. These included the lack of trained youth officials, lack of youth facilities, decrease in number of members, and unwillingness of parents to enroll their children in the Ustasha Youth. All this was further influenced by organizational failures and deteriorating security situation in various regions, which caused diminishing of popular support and consequently led to a complete defeat of this radical policy of remolding of Croatian society.'}"

Their group (in fact, three groups in the three cities) was called Žena i društvo [Woman and society] and their aim was to reconsider the state-declared emancipation of women.

There is a strong interference between the language they create through the reading of theories, social science and humanities research, art and literature and their activism, language creating practice and practice creating discourse. “Practice” even turns into semi-institutions by the late 1980s in the form of SOS helplines and the first shelters for women and children victims of domestic and gender based violence.

It uses archival sources and periodicals to examine the Christian and Muslim literary responses to the nineteenth and twentieth century intellectual developments in Europe and the Middle East such as positivism and biblical criticism that challenged traditional religious discourses. This study ties in several historical fields, beginning with the highly limited historiography of Ottoman religious polemics, and moving to studies on religion in the modern era, Protestant missionaries in the Ottoman Empire, imperial governance in the age of New Imperialism (1870-1914), and the global Muslim print sphere that developed in response to these challenges facing the Muslim world.

This dissertation approaches the history of relations among Muslim literati, Protestant missionaries, and Ottoman Christian literati through the prism of religious polemics. These writers included journalists, 'ülemâ members, government administrators, American, British, and German missionaries, and religious converts. This dissertation builds on new studies in late Ottoman historiography that explore the zones of contact between Ottoman confessional groups in the economic, political, and legal arenas by historicizing religious debates in the broader context of the Ottoman literati's encounter with the intellectual traditions of the Enlightenment, but also the changing Muslim-Christian power relations within and outside the Empire. It challenges the idea in Ottoman historiography that inter-religious relations irreversibly declined throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, culminating in the Empire's ruin. This dissertation's focus is not on the spiritual dimensions or theological contents of these polemics, but on this genre as a means of expressing and engaging this period's social and intellectual challenges.

The centrality of health and sanitation to the idea of modernity, in combination with the portrayal of Russia as intrinsically “backward”, led Russian educated elites and medical professionals to see their mission as making the country healthier and cleaner to urgently bridge the perceived gap with “advanced” Western societies. This dissertation examines the activity of the late-imperial Moscow elites in the sphere of urban sanitation between the mid-1870s and 1905, the time when municipalities, empowered by the new Municipal Statute, were - together with zemstvos - the highest elected political bodies in the Russian Empire. The main research problems of the dissertation are: which motivations - scientific, ideological, social, or economic - were behind the sanitary reforms, who cared and why they cared and which shape their goals took in practice. The dissertation aims to bring the urban dimension to the history of late-imperial Russian medicine and public health and the health dimension to the Russian urban history. Although in nineteenth-century Russia the emerging field of public health became a highly politicized subject and contested arena of policy, scholars have devoted little attention to the local politics of health and the use of medical sciences in urban reforms. In the recent decades the understanding of nineteenth century urban public health reforms as pillars of the emerging welfare state was subject to revision. Under the influence of a Foucauldian approach they were reinterpreted as disciplinary tactics, strategies of surveillance and mechanisms of creating liberal subjects. In the field of Russian studies, Laura Engelstein argued that Foucauldian explanatory model generally does not apply to the Russian context because of the absence of rule of law. Daniel Beer objected to Engelstein's argument and claimed that not just the radical but also the liberal project of “ozdorovleniye” was by definition coercive and that imperial scientists and Russian liberalism in general were forerunners of the oppressive solutions of the Soviet regime. Beer, however, did not investigate how scientific knowledge and theories translated into public policy in pre-revolutionary Russia - the problem that is tackled in the present dissertation. The general approach to the historical sources in the project combines intellectual history of scientific and political debates with the analysis of the actual social policy in the sphere of sanitary regulation. The dissertation relies primarily on the holdings of the Moscow city archive as its source base and consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 explains the organization of public health in post-Reform Russia, its legal and institutional framework, and discusses the discipline of hygiene that provided the scientific grounds for the sanitary reforms. It argues that in Russia hygiene and bacteriology were not in opposition, but instead hygiene embraced new bacteriological discoveries and remained the umbrella science for the campaign against disease. Chapter 2 introduces the social, legal and political context of Moscow, the periodization and the general dynamics of the sanitary reforms and the actors involved. It highlights the major themes in the city discussions on sanitation: 1) Moscow's perceived “backwardness” and the necessity to catch up with the “European standard”; 2) the “public good” seen as the moral obligation of the municipality and the city elites to improve the life of the urban poor through promoting science and public health at the expense of the city; 3) municipalization of all health-related services presented as the best mechanism of overcoming “backwardness” and achieving “public good”. The three remaining chapters are the case-studies of specific sanitary reforms. Chapter 3 looks at the reform of syphilis prevention, which resulted in the creation of free medical services for those suffering from venereal disease. Chapter 4 explores the construction and operation of the public abattoir that marked a major step in establishing sanitary control over food products. Chapter 5 studies the campaign against river pollution and the appearance of the sewerage system - a fundamental change in the collection, removal and treatment of urban wastes. The dissertation argues that the sanitary undertakings of the municipal project of “ozdorovleniye” implied both “serving the people” and disciplining them. The service to the urban community and to the ideals of public good was expressed in applying scientific knowledge, technology and the municipal resources to fight disease and provide medical assistance to those in need. The disciplinary mechanisms were introduced through constructing, disseminating and imposing new norms of “healthy”, “hygienic” or “civilized” behavior and training the “uncultured” people to live their life according to the model that the elites had in mind. Both of these entangled processes were hindered by the social and political realities of the Russian Empire, particularly the remarkable volatility of the urban population, the scarcity of city finances, the limited legal competence of the municipal government and its lack of juridical, administrative and symbolic power over the city population. The dissertation stresses, however, that it was not only these external factors that limited the implementation of the municipal “public good” goals but that understanding of the “public good” was in itself very narrow, and the vision of serving urban community had strong disciplinary overtones. Yet, surveillance and disciplining functioned effectively only in respect to selected social groups, while the circle of potential beneficiaries of the newly-created public health structures was much wider."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Closely following this, the second part of the chapter discusses the role of the narrative of leadership and charisma in creating hierarchies of power within state and society. These hierarchies were formed a binomial between leadership and the people, who were also given an important role, as fascism attempted to level social difference in favor of an organic community of the people, with a singular leader. This kind of definition of the people constitutes the topic of my third subchapter. The final sub-chapter of the second part of the thesis analyzes the narrative in which these concepts of people, nation, and leader were arranged. The narrative theorizing was disguised as historicist, but ultimately was an a-historic and anti-historic theory. The Hungarian nation would enter into a new phase of existence that would constitute the end of history, a sort of perpetual golden age.

I argue that by reconfiguring the principles of visual and material cultures, art professionals offered their specific vision of socialism, in many ways continuous with the Russian avant-garde and based on honest and creative relationships with objects, cheerful labor using beautiful, ergonomic tools and comfortable environments for recreation and self-expression. Extensively exploiting archival and published sources, I analyze ideas, debates, projects, material objects and exhibitions across the closely interconnected fields of applied art, monumental art and industrial design, thus offering a view of post-war Soviet design in a broad sense. By revealing multiple voices of creative individuals, this study moves beyond existing interpretations of Soviet design as a weapon in the cultural Cold War, an instrument of social control employed by experts on the state’s behalf, or simply as an exercise in the plagiarism of Western models. As my analysis demonstrates, by the late 1960s Soviet art professionals succeeded to create a vibrant intellectual space between conformity and dissent.

The complex topic of policies relating to the Hungarian Jewish community, individuals of Jewish origin and the state of Israel facilitates the multidimensional examination of the post-Stalinist Party state at work. It also facilitates the testing of political models of communism, which aim to describe “real socialist” regimes by way of totalitarian or authoritarian characteristics. The dissertation focuses on the main loci of political decision-making in the Party state and explains why and in what context the ‘Jewish Question’ emerged. The main topical areas that are discussed are policies relating to the Hungarian Jewish community, various forms and manifestations of antisemitism, and relations with the state of Israel. The dissertation argues that Jewish policies did not follow the general direction of the Kádár regime’s first decade, which has been described in academic literature as a clear trajectory from orthodoxy to liberalization. Kádárism, while officially relegating Jewish affairs in the realm of religious matters, facilitated the manipulation of the understanding of Jewishness through an institutional power structure that yielded to the personal and group interests of the political elite that operated it. As a consequence, various tensions that had existed between Jewish and non-Jewish Hungarians before the establishment of a communist regime in 1948 repeatedly filtered through the political framework set by the Party state. At the same time, this situation resulted in the repeated, but not systematic discrimination of those who were considered, at one time or another, Jewish. In the long run, this situation led to the survival of antisemitism, but also a distinct Hungarian Jewish identity, both of which powerfully resurfaced after the systemic change in 1989.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1777k)'}"

I argue that Ukraine, as any other nation, was imagined and constructed even in its seemingly most stable and down-to-earth dimension, which is territorial. In treating this kind of construction process as a research problem I demonstrate how at the end of the nineteenth â€“ beginning of the twentieth centuries vast, disjoined and divergent territories of the Romanov and Habsburg Empires were turned into one coherent Ukrainian national space and the territorial concept of the modern Ukrainian nation appeared. As this is a study of a ceaseless process of constant negotiations and discussions between the main actors which aims at presenting a cohesive picture of Ukrainian national space construction, I studied both of its stages: first, how the Ukrainian activists of the nineteenth century tried to create an idea of what the national territory of Ukraine was and, second, how this idea was later brought to life and disseminated. This will give the reader an idea of space which is a social product and thus is subject to change. An important aim of the thesis is to argue that these discussions were not only sui generis, but were also closely entangled with other contemporary contexts: Russian imperial, Russian national, Little Russian, Polish, Romanian, Lithuanian, and Czech among others.

On the other hand, the infrastructural extension was complemented by a cultural accomplishment. The regulations territorialized social relations in two ways: they gradually suppressed both the local agreements between landlords and peasants and the private relations (privileges) between princedom and various social actors. By addressing all subjects at once, the regulations fostered a link between them and the state. The new instruments of storing administrative knowledge enhanced the stateâ€™s capacity of surveillance. Finally, the standardization of measures substituted the local measures with central ones. Valid at all times and in all places, the standard measures transcended social divisions and proclaimed the equality in front of measure. Through these administrative practices, the state extended its capacity to act at a distance, redefined the area of legitimate intervention and appeared as an objective and equidistant entity.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2363k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The focus of this thesis will not fall on presenting the reader with a history of the Iron Guard or a history of the Church through the lenses of the Romanian fascist movement. Rather, by emphasizing the interplay between different layers of authority both in the Legion and in the Church, the present undertaking presents a net of negotiations and careful retreats from both sides. Working around the concepts proposed by Roger Griffin, that is fascism “as a palingenetic form of ultra-nationalism” regarding the movement, and “religious fascism” regarding the Orthodox Church’s low clergy derailment to the extreme right, I will show that on terms of ritual and theology the Iron Guard and the Orthodox Church were able to meet by making compromises. The thesis discusses the risk in assuming that the Orthodox Church acted as one, coherent institution, with a clear cut top down decision making process in its relation to the Iron Guard which as its turn cannot be regarded as one but a plurality inside the label. I have thus identified at least four distinct groups, three being active in the devising of this relationship. There is a distinction in how the low and the high clergy interact with the Legion. With regards to the Legion I have focused on an intellectual group that comprised religious minded individuals with direct or indirect ties with the institution of the Church. There was a side in the Legion and also one in the Church who did not involve itself in this relation. The most ambiguous game among all three factions was played by the high clergy. Acting individually in support of the movement or giving the movement the feeling that in the end they will join in officially, the high clergy used the movement in order to further their own political agenda. The most interesting outcome of these relations was the creation of a legionary theology. By projecting the Christian narrative of redeeming the individual to national proportions, the legionary priests and ideologues created something unparalleled in the history of European fascism: a theological synthesis in which the clergy brought its ideas and performed the sacerdotal function of the movement and the fascists brought the promise of a national salvation in the beyond. The coexistence of Christian sacraments with the sacrament of the movement, the need to couple the Gospels with the legionary writings of the Captain, the emphasis on a redeemed community in the beyond, these are few of the elements of this legionary theology.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2142k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The focus of this project is on premarital counseling and on preparation for marriage in general, which includes the production of sexual knowledge through sex education materials. Marriage counseling thus, at least as it was primarily understood in mid-20th century Hungary, becomes primarily a health issue and a preparation of young adults for proper marriage in a biological sense. I examine the 1941 Hungarian Marriage Law in detail and treat both the policies it implemented and the discourses that led to it as a Foucauldian, biopolitical attempt at sexual normalization. In this framework marriage counseling is both a “secularized confessional” and an attempt by power to induce self-normalization through a “discoursive ferment”. The study points to the anti-miscegenation clause in the Marriage Law and treats race defilement cases as further attempts at defining the borderlines of “respectable” sexuality, which resulted in a broad understanding both of “race protection” and of “marital health” in contemporary Hungary.

Jácint Rónay’s attempts to transfer the latest developments in the natural sciences from London to Pest in the early 1860s were not only hindered by circumstances and distance, but the attention of the public and the scientific community alike was too much caught up in the events leading up to the Compromise and the institutional reorganization of scientific life. By the early 1870s, however, members of the Academy and the scientific societies were finally in a position to capitalize on the critical point when the consequences of the Compromise permitted a new, open engagement with the natural sciences and their social and political implications. As Darwinism gradually entered not only scientific but also public discourse, the Darwinian concepts of progress and development became part of the rhetorical apparatus of social and political reform agendas in late nineteenth century Hungary.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1745k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

What emerged was a system retaining the merit-based character of the former pension regulations but modifying the eligibility criteria, the pension values and the institutional structure of the provision. Over the years the successive changes meant that pension evolved from a relatively insufficient provision available to a limited number of people to a sum that was aimed at enabling all pension-aged Hungarians to lead a relatively decent life. The dissertation follows the unfolding of this process. It offers a nuanced narrative of the evolution of the pension system in the period between 1948 and 1990, bringing macro and micro level analysis together. It focuses on how particular decisions were conceived and executed and what roles did the various levels of political decision making played in bringing about them. The dissertation also highlights how the expectations about pension and the state’s responsibility for financial wellbeing in old-age evolved throughout the period. It argues that the pension system was used in a strategic political manner throughout the entire history of socialist Hungary. Early on the pension system started to shed its preference for workers and employees – an inheritance from the interwar period – in an attempt to placate the agricultural sphere following the forced collectivization. Later the increasing pension values were used to strengthen the legitimacy of the regime. And finally, during the regime change the pension system was expanded in order to curtail unemployment and social unrest. The dissertation also contends that while conceiving the new measures and regulations, decisionmakers tried to live up to different and often contradictory expectations. On the one hand, economic considerations played a very important role during the entire period: not only was long-term sustainability an aspect always considered, but the pension system was used from very early on to achieve the regime’s particular economic goals and to assist its workforce management. On the other hand, considerations about the financial wellbeing of the pensioner population just as well as about the growing state responsibility with regard to old age were also present, and these considerations often overrode the financial and economic ones. Finally, the development of the Hungarian pension system is placed in a larger European context, using examples both from other socialist and non-socialist countries to show the extent to which Hungary – with respect to pension provisions, at least – fit in the general trend of European welfare state development after the Second World War.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1322k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

In this work, urban history meets issues related to architecture, sociology, cultural history, literature and ethnography since A Tale of Two Hungarian Cities aims to map the paradigms of change within the methodology of urban history by offering an interdisciplinary analysis of both towns. I focus on the (self) representation of each city, a manner of representation which gains increased importance by a transformation from the narrated city to the cultural translatability of the narrating city. There is a longstanding tradition of urban historical research in the Hungarian historiographical tradition. However, there are still a number of methodological questions, which are waiting to be explored, among them the comparative analysis of provincial cities. This dissertation maps the histories of Debrecen and Szeged in a less traditional way: besides analyzing the economic and social histories of the two towns, I focus on their cultural histories (and their development) and on the identity-making processes in these towns, especially as presented in their local newspapers. I analyze the representation of these cities in three areas: 1. urban planning and architecture; 2. local press, and 3. associational life. It is through these foci that I show how Debrecen and Szeged that had been only emerging provincial towns took off after the Compromise of 1867, and developed through different trajectories, especially after the Great Flood of 1879 in Szeged.

In temporal terms this study is limited only to the period of the the longest war the Republic of Venice ever fought with the Ottoman Empire, the war known as the War of Crete (1645-1669). Although the War of Crete was just the first in the series of three subsequent wars fought in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries between these two states, in many respects, it represented a turning point. On one hand, in spite of resounding victories in the Dardanelles (1654-1657), and tenacious defense of Candia, the Republic failed to achieve its objectives in these zones, and the war did end with Ottoman victory and conquest of the island of Crete. On the other hand, in the Adriatic theater of operations, fortunes were reversed. In Dalmatia, Venice won its most celebrated land victories of this war, crowned its success by taking two sandjak beys as prisoners, and for the first time after a series of defeats during previous wars (1537-1539 and 1570-1573), the Republic could claim local victory in this region, and expand its territory. Although Venetian territorial gains in this war were insignificant when compared to those of the following two wars - when all the land between the Adriatic Sea and the Dinaric mountains was re-conquered - nevertheless, for the first time, the Ottomans were stopped and even pushed back on the eastern Adriatic shore. To a lay eye, such final result of this war, the Venetian loss of the Island of Crete and limited territorial gains in Dalmatia, may seem as a very unlikely outcome. Although the Ottoman Empire had by the 17th century affirmed its position as a first class naval power in the Mediterranean, its main strength still rested on land. The series of unbroken victories against Christian powers in the course of the last two centuries preceding this war was more than impressive, giving its land forces a frightening reputation. On the other hand, even if by the mid-17th century the golden age of Venetian maritime power was long gone, the Republic was still a respectable naval power with a long tradition and experience in naval warfare. If 3/451 anywhere, it was on the sea that the Republic\'s best chance for challenging the Ottoman Empire was to be found. Achieving victory at sea and thus securing its possessions in the Levant seemed a more likely scenario than the denial of victory to Ottomans in Dalmatia, where the Empire could deploy its massive land forces. However, the course of events proved to be just the reverse. Through research of the Venetian military commitment in the Adriatic theater of operations during the War of Crete, this study aims to provide solid basis for the understanding of such and unlikely outcome of this war. The main theme of this study is best defined as the research of successes and failures of early-modern state administration in an ""imperial republic"" (supposedly in a condition of decline), in the liminal situation of war waged against a ""real"" empire (also supposedly in a condition of decline). The thesis is divided into three parts, each dealing with one particular context. The first chapter the ""Military-Political Context,"" provides a sketch of the historical background, giving an overview of war events in the Dalmatian theater of operations during the War of Crete. The second chapter: ""Military-Administrative Context"" deals with a range of topics; in the first place with the structure and organization of the Venetian armed forces in Dalmatia, the structure of the military command, civil organs of control, and provides a general overview of the Venetian military commitment in Dalmatia. Additionally, this chapter also covers the problematic question of the integration of the Morlacchi in the Venetian defensive system in Dalmatia, and strives to provide the evaluation of the Morlacchi contribution to the overall Venetian war effort in this battlefield. The common theme that is interwoven into each of these inquires is that of military administration. Finally, the last chapter the ""Logistical Context"" tackles the problem of the supply of the Venetian forces in this battlefield, aiming to grasp the scale of the challenge the Republic of Venice faced in maintaining its war effort in Dalmatia, for more than two decades.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (4943k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

It argues that the terminology and worldview behind it rested on Ciceronian humanist foundations, which formally were identical in the case of interpersonal and interstate relations. The way this language could operate among states is described  with the various senses of a cluster of terms around friendship and affections. The second chapter discusses those objects of the  presented affection that served as the right goal for the activity of states. The three main components, common good,  peace  and  fight against tyranny are discussed together with their concrete application in the context of the war. The vocabulary discussed shows a combination of the old and new humanist language, which were smoothly applied together.

My analysis comprises several layers. First the political, social and ideological transformations of the Roanian communist state represent the necessary background against which science fiction is analyzed. Second, science fiction is placed in the literary dynamic of the Romanian communist period. How science fiction emerged in Romania, what were the institutional structures, who were the persons involved, and how the development of the genre is related with the development of literature in general, mainly as a consequence of the political transformations, are some of the questions that were addressed in this thesis. Moreover, as they are an essential link between the writers and the readers, the system of publications from financing, circulation, print run, and distribution, through censorship, was also tackled. Third, an analysis of the science fiction literary discourse - yet without applying aesthetic criteria - is an important aspect in assessing the social functions of science fiction. The narrative elements and structures so much blamed by mainstream literary critics for their lack of literary merit are nevertheless valuable since they may uncover the type of message delivered by the genre to its readers. Fourth, the science fiction community is also investigated. A literary genre for children and youth without a significant tradition in Romania before communism, science fiction developed following the Soviet model especially as an active pedagogical and propagandistic instrument meant to build the new communist man. However, during communism it evolved from a didactic medium meant to disseminate scientific knowledge among its readers into a ‘catalyst’ for ‘alternative and rather free’ spaces of socialization. Magazines, fanzines, novels, and almanacs constitute the primary sources for the investigation. Moreover, works on literary criticism, social and political articles published in the newspapers and in the literary journals, memoirs, and historical works are extensively drawn upon for background information. Last but not least, perhaps the most important place in the economy of the sources is granted to oral history investigation. Existing scholarship has neglected this topic. Literary critics considers science fiction as having a meagre aesthetic value and do not deserve attention while historians have not considered placing the genre it its historical context relevant for the history of communism. Yet, as I demonstrate in my thesis, the analysis of science fiction, both its literature and community, offers important insights into the intellectual, political and social history of this period contributing also to the analysis of youth culture during communism.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3871k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

These chapters in turn clarify the differences between seven identity options (patriotic, nationalistic as well as five takes on dual identity labeled combined, mixed, primarily Jewish, formally dual and internally conflictual), analyze declarations of five different values as fundamental and fundamentally Jewish (ethics, truth, intellect and culture, life, adaptation and loyalty) and tackle five interpretations of the relevance of historicity stretching from stressing the completely ahistorical to emphasizing the thoroughly historical character of Jewry.

It analyzes the functions and dynamics of the historical front in the regime’s politics of knowledge and identity. By means of inquiry on the relationship between personnel, institutions, and policies I study the evolution of the various themes and topics that appeared within the historians’ epistemic community and their relationship with the political discourse of the Romanian communist party. I map out the development and features of the gradual hybridization between the historiographical constructions of the Nation and the party’s self-definitions and narratives about Romania and its society past, present, and future. I argue that, between 1955 and 1966, one can identify a wide process of adaptation, organization, control, and synthesis in the politics of science and of history with tremendous, cumulative effects on the political discourse of the communist party. The culmination of these phenomena were the years 1964 and 1965, when the party‘s political discourse will converge with the historians’ own narratives on the subject of collective identity. The present work is an attempt to overcome the binary model of historians versus the party. It does this by taking into account the ecosystem of history-production in Romania, with its specific traditions, ideological conditionings, and strategic positions within a communist polity that constantly avoided reform and persevered in constructing Stalinist civilization. I also pursue a comparative approach trying to see how the Soviet model of planned science and cultural transformation transferred in the Romanian context and the extent to which some of the dynamics of the local historical front were part of synchronic developments across Eastern Europe. I conclude that, starting with 1955, the master narrative of Romanian historiography would mature based on the growing symbolic progression of ancestors - kin (neam) - people – nation – socialist nation. This process reached its climax into the principle of a unitary, homogeneous, demotic nation that continuously evolved on the road to progress in time. Ultimately, history-production became fundamentally, if not exclusively, preoccupied with reflecting the rebirth of the national being across history with the construction of socialism as final stage. This role was far from unfamiliar for Romanian historians. In pre-communist times, their craft had more often than not taken the form of a national and political discipline (if not science). By 1966, historians had officially regained their pre-1945 function of apostles of the Nation. The evolution and resulting features of history-production from 1955 to 1966 were the outcome of the gradual alignment of scientific personnel and institutions, of scholarship and political discourse, and, ultimately, of ideology along the lines of a re-imagination of the Romanians as a national community under Stalinism.

The Church was stripped of its social functions and left with ceremonial roles that served to legitimate the state. It was no longer an autonomous body but through economic, legal, cultural and social ties it became a dependant of the state. This put a dent in the much looked after doctrine of caesaro-papism since the Church had no longer a sufficiently strong status to challenge the state and negotiate its position in society. There were periods after 1918 when this situation was reversed by the Church. At the end of the Second World War a status quo characterized the relationship between the Romanian state and the Church. Much of its hierarchy was publicly outspoken in social, educational, political matters, while economically still dependant on the political administration politically it became an important factor in public life. The change of regimes after the Second World War brought about an increase in the new regime’s interest in the Church and its position in society. The communists acted on a pre-existing soviet model already tested in the regulation of the Soviet Union religious life. Policies were drafted following this model regarding the role of the Church, if and how it could have been replaced and by what. It was one of the few steady attempts to reform institutional religion to fit the role designed for it by the state. This research focuses on the church – state relationship as defined in the early years of Romanian communism (1948-1960). Through the lens of three case-studies it attempts to uncover the subversive factors (lack of trained cadres, an overlap between trying to use the religious denominations and trying to relegate them and so on) that compromised the “orthodox” model of relationship that came from the soviets or was fabricated by Party policy makers and introduced new regulations and ultimately a different/new model of relationship. Thus I show how the blueprints and policies regarding the regulation of religious life in communist Romania were challenged when put into practice from inside the central communist administration, from outside the political administration (by the Church) and from below.

The current dissertation aimed at finding a way to make sense of a past time such as the interwar period, and especially of the emergence and development of fascism in the Romanian context. By placing the dissertation in the proximity of the “culturalist” approach I have started from a research hypothesis which assesses that fascism is a “coherent body of thought” (Roger Eatwell) a revolutionary political ideology which puts forward as its principal aim the necessity to regenerate a so-called state of decay and decline by bringing about a “new man” and a “new order.” Analyzing fascism from within, and considering it as a solid ideological construct, I wanted to better understand the diverse social support it garnered and the mass appeal that assured its political success in various contexts. Using archival material and interwar newspapers, journals and publications, I have attempted to understand the mass-appeal enjoyed by fascism in Romania in the 1930s and to explain the elements that attracted so many followers to the Legion, especially from the young generation. The thesis was structured having in mind the chronological aspect, with 1927 as the founding year of the Legion and 1937 being its most successful one. Furthermore the thesis focused on certain topics of interest, such as the “1922 student generation” and its political commitment, the adherence of the Axa group of intellectuals to the Iron Guard, the legionary work camp system, the social base of the legion and its political success in the 1937 elections. What I have tried to show throughout the dissertation was that the Legionary regenerative project aimed at saving the country from a perceived state of decay by creating a “new man” and a “new order” was regarded by many as a viable, albeit radical solution, and also satisfied the need for political activism for a great part of the young generation. Its ultimate failure, together with its violent record and tragic outcome are part of the one of the darkest chapters in twentieth-century Romanian history.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2420k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Visiting student at Western European universities. Rector of the distinguished College of Nagyvarad, accused of Puritan sympathies. Scribe at the Greater Chancellery of the Principality of Transylvania. Interpreter and diplomat at the Transylvanian embassy in Constantinople. Captive in the dreaded fortress of the Seven Towers. Chancellor of Mihai Radu, Voievod of Wallachia. Secretary of an exiled Voievod of Moldavia, Gheorghe Stefan, his representative at the Diet of Hungary and a member of the retinue during his journey to Muscovy. Diplomat at the court of the Crown of Sweden. Court Counselor of the Elector of Brandenburg and promoter of the Hungarian students in Berlin. Author of the only Early Modern treatise on the Ottomans written by a Hungarian. The first part of the dissertation (chapters I–IV) offers a detailed reconstruction of Harsanyi’s activities. Through his person, an analysis of the contexts in which he lived – some of which have received meager attention so far from earlier historiography, such as the micro-societies of the Transylvanian embassy at the Sublime Porte or the court of exiled Romanian Voievods – became possible. His contribution to 17th century Oriental Studies is also analyzed in this part of the thesis. The second part (chapters V–VI) is dedicated to analysis of Harsanyi’s writings from the perspective of questions related to his identity. First, his self-fashioning is described along two major elements: the “bureaucrat” (that is, the faithful, diligent and humble servant of the various princes under his career) and the intellectual (his attempts to gain higher prestige through an emphasis on his Latin education and intellectual skills). Connected to this, his adherence to Puritanism – a general assumption in the earlier historiography – is also put under scrutiny and inferences are traced between his rhetoric and debating methods and those of the contemporary Puritans in Hungary. Lastly, the question of Harsanyi’s attitude towards the Turks in his writings is addressed. The difference between the image of the Turk in the Colloquia and the one drawn by his diplomatic correspondence is explained through changes in the circumstances in international affairs, in his authorial position as well as in his political agenda.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1906k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

In order to contribute to the refocusing of the debate, on the basis of representative clusters of cases, the thesis aspires to reconfigure the field by replacing current perceptions of the practice with nuanced differentiations between the diversity of historical expertise during the course of the age of extremes. To that end, it searches for epistemological and genealogical preconditions of historians’ appearance in the courtroom and scrutinizes the institutionalization of the practice in different jurisdictions in the postwar period. Dominant paradigms of institutionalized historical expert witnessing are examined, as well as problematizatons surrounding their amalgamation. The complexities of contemporary historical expertise are further explored through examples which evade the debated paradigms by transgressing the boundaries of particular legal systems and pose the questions of universal relevance both to lawyers and historians in the process of the internationalization of historical expert witnessing.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2386k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Understanding travel and travel writing as a “means of world-making and self-fashioning” presents travel as a fascinating venue for the exploration of the development of modern identity. My specific focus on the history of Russian travel and travelogue determines the two-fold thrust of this work. On the one hand, I look at the historical evolution of European styles and ideologies of travel and forms of travel writing (particularly focusing on the moments of transition). On the other hand, I analyze the relationship between western European textual models, ideologies and practices of travel and travelogue and their Russian adaptations, tracing continuities and ruptures between the historically evolving notions of both Russia’s domestic and foreign spaces from medieval religious imagination to modern secular consciousness. What conceptual framework should one apply to the nuances of the specifically Russian context without relapsing into patronizing, Orientalist appropriations? To what extent are western paradigms useful, if at all, in writing the history of Russian travel and travelogue? What is the role of social and cultural determinants in the evolution of Russian travelogue, a genre, which is too often considered exclusively in terms of its textual characteristics? My assumption is that the historically sensitive analysis of paradigms of travel and travel narratives illuminates mechanisms of cultural, social and ideological change and cross-cultural translation/adaptation, of which these practices are both agents and upshots and that the poetic essence of travelogues (e.g. narrative strategies, inter-textuality, sophisticated imagery) is coeval with their political contingency. Practices and narratives of travel reflect and elaborate conceptions of space and place, border (of separation or of distinction?) and border crossing, devising imaginary, symbolic maps for the actual landscapes covered during the journeys. They highlight conjunctions between the perception/imagination of space and the national character and psyche. Ultimately, and most importantly, the exploration of foreign realm and encounter with difference inevitably compels the traveler to engage with his or her own individual, national or artistic identity. It is here that the foreign country truly becomes a springboard for reflecting on one’s own, a metaphor of the native realm.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (3635k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

This competition was determined by Bessarabia’s position as a borderland and by the region’s marginality within the two conflicting projects of empire- and nation-building. Bessarabia provides an example of the entanglements, ambiguities and interconnections between discourses and practices of “nation” and “empire” that shape each other and also the fate of the populations inhabiting the physical and symbolic borderlands between polities that define themselves on the basis of opposing legitimizing principles. However, I also attempt to show that the population of the borderlands may, at certain moments, develop its own agency or react to central policies in ways unforeseen by their proponents.

Frequently influenced by the agendas of various local elites, who sought to use imperial expansion for self-promotion, Russian authorities eventually embraced the course of reform of Moldavian and Wallachian institutions as a means of acquiring hegemony and solving the perennial problem of permeability of imperial frontiers. At the same time, the policies of Russian administration in the principalities in 1828-1834 were conditioned by contemporary institutional development of the Russian Empire, which reflected changing role of the nobility in the course of imitation of the institutions and practices of the Central European well-ordered police state. Outlining the prerogatives of the princely authorities and the boyar assemblies, regulating the relationships between landlords and peasants, consolidating public service, administration and general police, the Organic Statutes of Moldavia and Wallachia produced in an uneasy collaboration between Russian authorities and Romanian boyars, contributed to progressing distancing of Romanian principalities from the Ottoman Empire. Serving the instruments of Russian imperial expansion, the institutions and practices of well-ordered police state introduced by the Organic Statutes, at the same time, can be viewed as the realization of the 18th territorial state centralization and therefore represent an important stage of early political modernization of Moldavia and Wallachia.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1733k)'}"

It argues that the period of economic reform opened up space for re-negotiating the terms of the agreement between the workers and the party in both countries. Social dialogue, however, ended in failure in both countries. The party refused to change the power structure; instead, it offered economic concessions to the workers albeit in different forms. For the workers the consumption-oriented policy that was followed in both countries became the basis of legitimacy, and given that it could not offer the kinds of consumption levels that existed in Western capitalist countries, it could only offer poor compensation for the actual lack of control over the means of production and limited political freedom. With the loss of the ideological battle the regime’s support among the working class crumbled, as it was increasingly difficult to sustain the loyalty of the working people. In the 1980s the signs of decline were visible in Hungary and repressed in East Germany. The mounting discontent of the population can be documented through regularly collected information reports. Ideological rigidity was more powerfully enforced in the GDR, where it was the mass flight of the population from the country after the opening of the Hungarian border that eventually demonstrated the unpopularity of the regime. Although both regimes failed, their different political climate was reflected in the memory of the two systems. The ambiguous picture of the Kádár era and the unambiguously negative judgment of the Honecker regime suggest that people regarded limited political freedom as being more important, than material concessions.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1939k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

To that end, autonomous weapons are seen as continuing in a historical trend of adopting modern technology and the concomitant knowledge production that such innovations bring along. The historical process of developing nuclear policy is shown to serve as a template for discussions on autonomous weapons. To the extent that weapons with autonomous structures will become technologically possible, the debate on autonomous weapons has been conducted with a framework already in existence due to nuclear weapons policy.

Employing an International Relations theoretical approach and using document analysis and interviews with experts from both paradigms, the thesis argues that goal-setting can also be useful for DE and that the differences between SD and DE ideationally can be overcome on the level of political implementation through goal-setting. By taking the 17 SDGs as a reference point, the thesis shows that DE is compatible with all goals, except SDG8 on economic growth.

However, the way it does so is characteristic of what we call neo-liberal humanitarianism. This is a structured frame of thought that through developmental action seeks to develop the areas of emigration (e.g. Libya) in order to create resilient local communities for the purpose of stemming migration while at the same time employing a humanitarian interventionist reasoning in order to legitimize growing intrusions into non-EUrope by framing the process in terms of saving lives and developing communities.

The militants take over the resources of the country. One of the successful coups in Turkey was by the Putschists who announced their take over using the national radio station. On the other hand, the failed coups in the country were due to failed strategies and inability to influence the military for support. Coups affect the stability of the country, including the political, economic, and social wellbeing of the citizens. People live in constant fear and there are constant fights between the leader of a coup and the existing president for power. The economic effect leads to low standards of living among the citizens of the country who do not have a regular flow of income that can support their families.

Second, “Wave”, “Strain” or “Wavy Strain” should be able to explain the pattern followed by Eco-Terrorism. Making use of the “Contagion Effect” as an analytical tool, the present research found that, like in other typologies, as an indirect way of contagion, literary production has played a crucial role in the spread of Eco-Terrorism, with a slight difference on who was writing them. Eventually, they became leaders or members of an organization, but in most of the cases were philosophers and fiction authors. In addition, it was found that the system of organization of the ALF and the ELF contributes to the spread. As a direct way of contagion, aside from training like in other typologies, the spread occurs when members of a certain organization disaffiliate from an organization and found a new one, and sometimes when two organizations act in cooperation. Furthermore, the present research found that there was a Eco-Terrorist Wave between 1980 and 2012.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1799k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The work of Charles Lipson is the basis of the thesis; however, the paper demonstrates an integrated approach to explaining the problem meaning that factors determined by several authors are taken into account. Thus, besides the major importance of Lipson’s paper, his work is modified to be better applied to the post-Cold war context and EU-Russia relations in particular. According to the results of the study, EU-Russia economic relations are more successful than security cooperation because of lower costs of betrayal, more transparency and predictability including availability of necessary information about each others’ actions, lack of competitive struggle and the shadow of the future based on long-term economic interdependency. Overall, economic relations appeared to be more institutionalized than in security field. Moreover, Russia’s bilateral ties with some European countries also play a consequential role in developing successful economic ties. Lastly, Lipson’s work is modified because in post-Cold War context, especially in the energy sector, security and economy are to some extent interlinked.

However, SSA countries differ in their success to attract this beneficial form of investment, therefore, the main question of this thesis is what explains Ethiopia’s achievement in attracting large flows of Chinese private investment, while other SSA countries failed to do so.

The thesis’s main findings are that Ethiopia does own some specific locational advantages, however, it fares below the regional average in most indicators.

In this light, the case study of India and Sweden provide a striking contrast in terms of pension systems and reforms. The research objective focuses on under what conditions reforms are successful.

The methodology of comparative case study and descriptive statistical tools assist in drawing lessons from Sweden for India.

What does explain this variation? I argue that the international authority of IOs plays an important role in shaping the level of access provision. IOs with high and low international authority levels provide less access than IOs with medium levels of authority. High authority IOs have no functional needs in involving TNAs because their high authority allows them to achieve their mandate goals on their own. Low authority IOs are neither mandated with tasks that may require additional input by TNAs nor delegated with enough authority to even initiate the access provision. In contrast, IOs with medium levels of authority experience an institutional shortage of authority for achieving the goals of their mandates. For this reason, they see a strong functional benefit in involving TNAs as a way to overcome their authority limitations. Medium authority provides them with enough institutional abilities to provide access, but at the same time limits their autonomy from member-states to fulfil their mandate goals without any involvement from third parties. The statistical results of the study provide support for the argument. They illustrate that there is non-linear inverse U-shaped relationship between the level of authority and the level of access: medium authority IOs provide the highest access, while low and high authority IOs provide less access.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1361k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Additionally, all of the previous regimes since Nasser implemented policies limiting the Muslim Brotherhood’s freedom. This enabled the organization to build up considerable support in civil society, which after the 2011 uprising threatened to rejig the hegemonic bloc ruling Egypt since Nasser and to weaken the preeminent role of the military in this bloc. I use a Gramscian analysis to argue that Sisi’s hegemonic project was able to produce popular consensus by channeling very little material benefits offered by the military institution to some subaltern classes and by implementing an ideological leadership based on a culture of counter-terrorism.

Among academics, one of the more contentiously debated aspects of its foreign policy is its principle of ‘non-interference.’ Literature thus far has been inconclusive regarding China’s adherence to this self-imposed principle. This paper attempts to contribute to this scholarly discussion by examining whether China adheres to the principle of ‘non-interference.’ It does so by examining if Chinese support for rebel organization leads to violence against civilians. This analysis stems from previous literature, which indicates external support from a non-democratic foreign patron leads to violence against civilians. The relationship is examined within the framework of the principal-agent theory. Given this theoretical foundation, I perform quantitative analysis of the hypothesis by adopting the general methodology of Salehyan et al. With zero-inflated negative binomial regression, I show that there is good empirical support that Chinese support for rebel groups leads to violence against civilians, at least in countries where China is involved.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1033k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Their swift and efficient operations on the Crimean Peninsula, followed by the protracted conflict in Donbas we see today illustrates tactics and technologies used in a decidedly different manner than many claim has been seen in the past. What the Russian military has done is apparent, how to respond is another question entirely. The answers to these questions have consistently been sought within the proposed model of so-called hybrid warfare. Russia was highly successful in using a mixed approach in their military campaign â€“ combining conventional and unconventional methods, in addition to their sponsorship of pro-Russian separatist groups. Comprehensive analyses of the tactics used, technologies adopted and proxy sponsorships employed certainly needs to be conducted. Whether this should be done within the framework of hybrid warfare, however, will be examined. What this research will posit, is that many aspects of the hybrid warfare model appeared due to individual actor agency on the ground, the pro-Russian separatists, rather than by clear Russian directives. If this is proven to be the case, then a frame of analysis which incorrectly assumes a unitary actor, Russia, initiating the tactics of freelancing proxies, the separatists, is flawed by its very basis.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (627k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Most research on external state sponsorship of rebel groups either implicitly assumes that state sponsorship remains unchanged over time or focuses only on changes in levels of support alone. This thesis examines state sponsor policy towards rebel groups by including both intensity of support and control measures designed to minimize agency loss. It argues that shifts in state sponsor perceptions of the rebel as either a security asset or a security liability leads to changes in its sponsorship policy. It hypothesizes that states perceiving groups as assets will follow a policy of support with minimal controls while those perceiving rebel groups as liabilities will follow a policy of punishment. In between the two extremes, states can have mixed perceptions and policies that combine conciliatory measures with limited sanctioning. By using longitudinal analysis, this thesis tests the perception-theory of external sponsorship using Jordanian and Syrian sponsorships of the Palestinian fedayeen groups as case studies. The empirical investigation shows that Jordan followed the hypothesized trajectory of sponsorship changes while Syria mostly followed mixed and punish policies. The thesis concludes by suggesting that a sponsor stateâ€™s proximity to an insurgency may make it more unpredictable and calls for policymakers to devote greater attention to sponsor state rhetoric and actions.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (987k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

There has been limited scholarship available in understanding the securitization of continuous threat. While the Copenhagen School does put forth the concept of institutionalized securitization where response to a recurrent threat becomes institutionalized in the form of establishment of military or bureaucracy; however, it does not elaborate on how the whole process of securitization unfolds when the nature of the threat is recurrent or continuous. The thesis aims to analyze intersubjective relationship between the actor and the audience over time and argues that securitization of continuous threat may not necessarily end in institutionalize form. The securitization process continues till security framing and contestation to adopt the means to deal with the threat are intersubjectively established among the actor and the audience. The case of securitization of terrorism in Pakistan is chosen to illustrate how securitization process unfolded when the continuous threat of terrorism became an existential threat to the state of Pakistan. By analyzing the intersubjective relationship between the government of Pakistan and the Parliament for the adoption and renewal of the National Action Plan (NAP) as counter-terrorism strategy, the thesis illustrates that securitization of terrorism did not end in institutionalized form.

This thesis is inspired by the socio-legal literature, a growing body of cross-disciplinary studies focusing on the legal-mobilization of interest groups, and raises the question of why NGOs turn to courts and under which conditions legal mobilization is likely to take place as a political strategy to seek political and legal influence. Most of the studies of strategic litigation have focused on the compliance aspect of litigation and extensively relied on structural (macro) level explanations for scrutinizes strategic litigation. This thesis takes a different approach for explaining strategic litigation by introducing the lens of ‘prior effective experience with the European court system’ as an explanatory variable. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative research, this thesis attempts to understand the relationship between prior legal action experience with European court system and the choice of strategic litigation before the European supranational court system. Furthermore, it focuses on European NGO’s legal mobilization battle at the European Court of Human Rights and European Court of Justice for transformation of European Asylum policy and The Dublin Regulations. This thesis suggests two significant empirical observations (1) There is a significant relationship between the organizations' prior legal experience with European supranational court system and choice of strategic litigation for seeking influence on European Asylum policy. (2) European Courts expanding interest in Asylum field boosts NGOs choice of strategic litigation for seeking influence on European Asylum policy which in return also expands European courts’ power on the policy area."", 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1696k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This, though, is irrelevant to anti-immigrant German politicians, who utilize sterilized data to build a case against in-migration of out-group individuals.

My findings indicated that ethnic partition would not achieve these goals, as rates of ethnic violence are lower in mixed municipalities, and the “security dilemma” is not determining inter-ethnic relations as Kaufmann predicts. To explain this, I applied Jenne’s nested security theory, which posits ethnic conflict within a state is not contingent on insecurity and fear, but rather based on the regional and global political environment. Applying this theory, I find that it is the elite policymakers in Belgrade and Pristina who have the most influence over tensions in Kosovo and the Preševo Valley. Using a short history section, I confirm this finding though the precedent of previous ethnic partitions in the Balkans. Based on my conclusion, I recommend the land-swap be disregarded as a means to normalize relations, and that the European Union discourage the idea while continuing the condition European integration on the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (633k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The sources and criteria of Nye’s soft power, however, have been widely argued and debated among scholars. The purpose of this paper is to further critique the sources of Nye’s soft power using existing literature. Some scholars have already demonstrated that it is hard to distinguish between the sources of hard and soft power. Zheng and Zhang, who are unsatisfied with Nye’s division of the sources of soft and hard power, alternatively they propose concern as soft power and force as hard power. According to them, a line between hard power and soft power cannot be easily drawn because single sources of power are interpreted differently by different actors in the changing circumstances of time in a recipient nation. They try to distinguish between hard and soft power in term of “force and consent”. However, Zheng and Zhang’s proposal still has weakness as both consent and force cannot be distinguished the two powers; in fact the lines between soft power and hard power assets are blurred as the spread of language and culture may well be achieved through partial coercion and acquired soft power assets serve as effective tools for the further expansion of influence without a necessity for consent. This paper further argues that on whatever sources of power can be either soft or hard depending on the context and situation which is being used.

For this purpose first the theories of ethnic mobilization are presented with a thorough assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in explaining the selected cases. A brief historical background of the minority issues in Ukraine is also provided for a comprehensive account on the causal effect of the minority radicalization and the nation-building as well as the time of their occurrence. Finally the thesis examines the behavior of the states through the lens of the ethnic bargaining model. The model suggests, that the kin state behavior is the key for minority behavior and the latter selects its step on the basis of the perceived leverage. If there is no outside support, the minority is not likely to radicalize its demands. On the other hand, if the minority is certain of outside support, it will radicalize despite the host state is non-repressive. The thesis argues that in the ongoing Ukrainian war the external kin states use the ethnicities inhabiting the territory for strategic reasons, and the minorities respond to differential levels of kin state support by radicalizing or moderating their demands. In this way, kin states help to mobilize or suppress minority claims for their own strategic purposes. In this game, the players are the minorities, the core group and the kin states. The minority is the only player choosing its positions on the basis of core group and the kin state signals.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1428k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Looking at selected crucial periods of the EU’s energy policy integration process, the thesis argues that energy policy integration tends to be driven by major member states, although the increasing role of the supranational body cannot be neglected. Meanwhile, energy policy coordination at the EU-level fluctuated over time as positive and negative energy policy integration also fluctuated, reflecting the changing nature and perceptions of the actors and the aims of the integration.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (596k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

With governments struggling in addressing major global issues, society is now increasingly calling in the private sector to do so by asking for companies to promote positive social change. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) embodies this new position of business in society and makes corporations no longer mere objects of regulation but rather political actors themselves involved in the definition and establishment of rules and norms. The scope of this thesis is to investigate nature and scale of MNCs’ political authority in the international system through the analysis of the CSR regime to provide for a better understanding of these new forms of governance. Yet, for this to be possible, a context-specific study of power is needed. Following a power analysis in which different power considerations are connected to different possible reasons for MNCs’ compliance with socially-responsible policies, CSR is here interpreted as a system of self-discipline and conformity from which MNCs result being both empowered and constrained. CSR – a by-product of the broader neoliberal regime of governmentality – by redefining the boundaries between public and private, invests firms with political authority while at the same time reinventing their social role in a way that the resulting system of governance ultimately both governs through and consists of the very success of its discourse in the global economy.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (682k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In times where China’s global presence was limited, the strict application of the principle was not problematic. However, China’s economic expansion has made the protection of Chinese citizens and interests beyond the country’s border a priority. I will argue that this unprecedented imperative is linked to the emergence of the norm of protection of Chinese citizens and interests. I will posit this norm has had domestic actors such as bureaucratic actors and grassroots pressures as its main drivers. The contribution this thesis intends to make to the literature is to illustrate that there is a clash between the long-held norm of sovereignty and the principle of noninterference and the norm of protection of Chinese Nationals and interests which emerged upon the globalization of Chinese economic interests. I will argue that this normative clash is problematic for the ruling Chinese Communist Party since it is inextricably connected to the imperative of government legitimacy and regime security. If the CCP derived its legitimacy from the protection of Chinese sovereignty against foreign aggression, securing its citizens and interests overseas has become a new source of legitimacy.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (694k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Also, I demonstrate the dissonance between minority and majority party status. I trace minority party politics as inclusive for refugees. This is a rational strategy for minority parties to maximize their constituencies. On the other side, majority party politics demonstrates that ideology is not enough to interpret the migration policies of the political parties. In other words, there are other reasons to see different level of inclusion within the party politics. I refer to historical nationalism as a source of exclusion of the left for their electoral considerations.

As the agricultural sector needs less high skill labor than the industrial sector, the rural elite, through their political and economic power, influence policies benefiting their own group instead of the general population. Though Brazil has gone through a process of industrialization, land inequality still impacts educational achievements in Brazilian municipalities. This research demonstrates that land inequality still negatively impacts public education achievements in Brazil even after the industrialization and decrease of agricultural importance in the economy.

Academic literature, as well as Auschwitz Museum’s own materials, depicts the site as the ultimate example of ‘dark tourism’, where tourists can learn about and reflect on the horrors of the Holocaust. Such literature also suggests that visitor behaviour is governed by the seriousness of the site’s history, pre-existing Holocaust narratives, and a Foucauldian sense that they are being watched and judged. However, for several years, mass media commentary has focused on tourists’ inappropriate behaviour when visiting Auschwitz Museum, particularly the ways that younger tourists take selfies and pose for self-portraits, just as they would at any other site of mass tourism. This mismatch leads one to ask whether Auschwitz Museum is a site of dark or mass tourism, what impact tourism and social media have on existing Holocaust narratives and taboos about visual depictions of the Holocaust, and whether selfies and self-portraits are as widespread as mass media would suggest or as non-existent as seen by academics. This thesis examines the impact that tourism has on existing Holocaust narratives and taboos about visual depictions of the Holocaust. It does this by looking at the conflict driven by the Museum’s educational mandate, which requires its acceptance and encouragement of tourism, and the extent to which signifiers of mass tourism suggest to tourists that they can behave as they would at any other mass tourism destination. It studies previous examples where there have been public debates about taboo-violating tourist photography at Auschwitz Museum, and qualitatively and quantitatively examines six months of Auschwitz Museum visitor selfies and self-portraits posted on photo and video sharing app Instagram, finding three themes: self-placement, witnessing, and rebellion.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (762k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This paper therefore, sheds light on the development-aid puzzle and elaborates on aid to sectors that deter migration. Furthermore, it illustrates why the ‘Paris school of thought’ is most suitable, compared to alternative security theories to define ‘mechanisms for determining level of securitized migration’. The paper uses these mechanisms to analyze the case study of Germany to show; that Germany had a history (narrative premise) of de-securitized migration, it observed a low level of securitized migration during the 2000’s and a high-level of securitized migration by the 2015 EU migration crisis – with a gradual shift occurring around pre and post 2013. The research uses a macro (overall ODA) and micro (ODA by sectors related to deterrence) level-analysis to support the hypothesis and bridge the empirical gap in literature. In conclusion, the research depicts a significant correlation between level of securitized migration and development-aid.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1392k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Researchers and the international community quickly began debating the benefits or disadvantages of such deals, as well as how they should be described. The rush for land reached its peak just after the food crisis, which raised awareness and concern not just among food insecure countries, but countries considered secured and developed. Still, although millions of hectares of land are at stake, little is known about the outcomes of these deals. It is important to know the reasons why such deals fail, since these failures may be the result of conflicts, governments’ disregard towards farmers, weak land tenure policies and hunger, the latter of which is present in the majority of the targeted countries. Therefore, this research focuses on the influence of the international community over land deals and on policies of target countries, as well as the importance of food security for their outcomes. For this purpose, through a quantitative analysis, this research investigates failed land deals, taking into consideration numbers and information regarding different countries’ Freedom and Food Security. This research also explores a case study of Madagascar, the country with the highest number of failed deals. The results of the data examined strengthens the hypothesis that food security and the international community is strongly correlated to failed land deals, once rural society can use its “secret weapon” to fight for their rights.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2117k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Why did it oust other forms of order, and why have they not reemerged in a meaningful fashion? Drawing on sociological literature, this thesis argues that the evolution and spread of states across the globe was a function of imperial interests that established a hierarchy that extends between and within states. This hierarchy was consecrated and ‘naturalized’ through developing moral, legal and normative frameworks and interrelated forms of practice. This naturalization, however, does not remove the imperial hierarchy, but makes it fundamentally misrecognizable within its paradigmatic structure. The habitus of ‘statehood’ in which states evolve and act thus takes on a religious quality through defining the boundaries of possible forms of order. Recognizing statehood as a system which is both structuring and structured, and with inherent contradictions which sustain the global hierarchy, is an important step in understanding the hegemony of Europe and the corresponding reproduction of other states as flawed and ineffective modes of governance, both in theory and practice.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (556k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Most of these challenges have their roots in the weakness of the continent’s institutions. Africa is without any scholarly or scientific objections the world’s richest continent in terms of natural resources. However, the continent is also known as the world poorest in terms of its economy and social development. The reasons for this paradox will be scrutinized in this thesis. The arguments of this thesis are based on the role of Africa’s regional and domestic institutions as causes of the current poor economy and social development of the continent. This paper seeks to evaluate the continent’s institutions from the past administrations to current ones. The paper will take aim on four majors institutions: political, security, economic, and social development institutions. First, this paper argues that the African continent’s colonial history still handicaps the economic growth and social development of the continent. Second, the natural resource and oil curse are often applied to most of the African countries because African countries, relative to many other countries rich in natural resources, are still less developed despite their immense and diverse resources. In this part of the paper, we will also claim that African countries are victims of a double curse: the natural resources curse and the colonialization curse. The third and most important part of the paper will discuss African institutions and will argue that strengthening the continent’s institutions at regional and domestic levels will assure economic growth and social development. This thesis research argues that the cause of African countries’ development misfortune lies in the continent’s weak institutions. Thus, strengthening institutions in the continent will be the most important way to drive Africa from its current situation to a flourishing social and economic development.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (946k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Moreover, the relationship between foreign policy and identity has mostly been analyzed in the field of IR through the Constructivist approach which states that ideas as social constructions influence the foreign policy and identity formation of a state. On the other hand, poststructuralist theory correlates foreign policy and identity through the methodology of discourse analysis. The advocates of poststructuralism argue that as identity and foreign policy can coexist, identities can reshape foreign policy-making and foreign policy can produce identity through special discursive practices. Following this assumption of poststructuralism about the relation between identity and foreign policy, this thesis analyses how victimization discourse in Azerbaijan based on the historical representation and memory of the Karabakh War, not only shaped the foreign policy of Azerbaijan during the peace talks after the war but also constructed the identity as victimized. Massacres, in particular, Khojaly ‘genocide’ and violence of the Karabakh War is elaborated, as these representations were solidified into the collective memory. In order to find the correlation between foreign policy and identity construction, the speeches of Azerbaijani presidents are analyzed and the last mobilization of people during the last clashes of the two nations is examined to prove this relation.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (678k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

By enforcing the stateâ€™s monopoly on armed forces and integrating political opponents, these mechanisms hold a promising potential towards the reconstruct war-torn nations. In 2016, the government of Colombia reached an historic peace deal with the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) guerrilla, thus ending the longest lasting civil war in the Americas. After more than 50 years of civil war, in which hundreds of thousands were killed and millions displaced, the implementation of DDR started. Now in its third year, the implementation is slow, uneven and is encountering several difficulties. In August 2019, some ex-FARC leaders called for the return of an armed insurgency, citing the failures of the Colombian government in implementing the Peace Agreement. As mitigated results of the DDR in Colombia emerge, an overall assessment is valuable.

While Chinese FDI stock in the Bloc has been declining for the past two years, it is increasingly concentrated in sectors that are considered strategically important by the EU. The EU has no harmonised FDI policy, but as a response to growing anxieties, the European Commission has put forward a non-mandatory FDI screening framework specifically to address Chinese FDI inflows. The mechanism goes into effect in 2020. To address the EU’s fears about Chinese investments with efficient policies and to identify wanted and unwanted investments, it is crucial to understand the determinants of Chinese FDI flows to the EU. This thesis employs panel data analysis to investigate these determinants, using data from between 2003 and 2018.

Contrary to claims that these ‘populist’ and ‘nationalist’ movements are idealess and anti-internationalist, recent developments suggest that the radical right articulate their own visions of international cooperation and world order. This paper analyzes how Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s right-wing prime minister, is trying to discursively reshape Europe’s role in the world. It does so through the conceptual framework of strategic narrative, which envisions international politics as a narrative struggle over shared meaning. Orbán’s strategic narrative of European cooperation and world order is reconstructed through a close reading of his annual speeches at the Bálványos Summer University and Student Camp since 2010. It is shown that the prime minister’s narrative conjures up a Christian Power Europe, which must act in the world according to the following core norms: stability, Christian liberty, national democracy, the rule of morality, and respect for sovereignty and cultural traditions. In opposition to Normative Power Europe, this narrative legitimizes Christian-flavored illiberalism as the means to make Europe great again on the world stage.

Previous research has noted that politicization of climate change has been underway in individual countries, however, the current thesis establishes, based on opinion polls and European Parliament election results, that this process has also occurred in the EU as all three criteria of politicization (increase in the salience, polarization of opinion and mobilization of public opinion) have increased over the last few years. Regarding energy policy, the thesis demonstrates that the deepening of energy policy integration has increased significantly, especially in the form of bottom-up pressure, thereby ’bringing politics’ into energy policy. Based on the neofunctionalist conceptual frame, the thesis concludes that the increased politicization of climate change among the public has fueled energy policy integration in the EU, becoming the main driver behind it and replacing thus the earlier driver of the Energy Union – energy security. More broadly, the thesis sets an example of a way in which public perceptions are capable of shaping or even driving policy issue integration in the EU.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1569k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The Russian act of justifying its involvement in Syria has been a recurrent theme of debate and contention, leaving behind confused analysts, scholars and policy makers. The goal of this thesis is to highlight and analyze how the Russian intervention in Syria is being framed through speech acts, UN statements and interviews by Russian leaders such as President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and UN Permanent Representatives Vassily Nebenzia and Vitaly Churkin internationally as well as at home to the Russian public. In this academic work, I claim that Russia uses the pro-sovereignty argument to justify its intervention in Syria. I conclude that President Putin and other Russian spokespersons are using the pro-sovereignty discourse of intervention rather than the ‘Responsibility to Protect’ reasoning for justifying their involvement in Syria. This paper opens up further scope for future research on the significant role that framing can play in analyzing foreign interventions. Finally, this work also emphasizes that the same pro-sovereignty argument has been used by Russia before during other instances of interventions, and thus can be used for suggesting a broader pattern of behavior from the Russian end.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (544k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The logic of historical explanation helps to understand that the main goals of Poland’s national geoeconomic strategy were 1) fully refusing to import gas from Russia by building additional gas transporting infrastructure and 2) become a regional gas hub by selling the surpluses provided by that infrastructure to its neighbors. For its gas supply diversification, Poland successfully used the opportunities provided by securitization of EU energy policies, strengthening of sub-regional infrastructural cooperation in East-Central Europe, and assertive promotion of US energy export by Trump’s administration.

The study of factors that could explain this is underdeveloped. Limited research, though, shows that cryptocurrencies are less regulated in economies with sophisticated legislation. In contrast to existing work, which does not differentiate between the hands-off approach of governments and permissive regulation, I argue that democracies with the developed legislature are less likely to ban cryptocurrencies but, at the same time, are more likely to apply permissive regulation to them. I also assume that factors, that matter in cryptocurrency adoption, may influence how governments respond to cryptocurrencies. This thesis answers the question of why cryptocurrency regulation differs across the world by examining the relationship between governmental response to cryptocurrencies, on the one hand, and the level of democracy and factors that matter in cryptocurrency adoption, such as corruption, inflation, and dependence on remittances, on the other hand. My main method of estimation is a cross-sectional ordered logit regression using data from Polity data series, World Bank database, and Transparency International. To measure the governmental response to cryptocurrencies, I create an index of 172 economies using the information on cryptocurrency legal and regulatory status available as of 2018, thus, my research does not capture regulatory changes over time. The results confirm my hypothesis regarding democracies. However, I find no evidence that adoption-related variables influence governmental response to cryptocurrencies.

As these new structural developments lead to a more fragmented multilateralism that challenges the neoliberal order, of which the European Union (EU), in its self-understanding, is the avantgarde actor, I examine how the EU responds to this new international context. To answer this question, I conduct discursive and partially policy analysis evaluating the explanatory power of two sets of hypotheses – realist and constructivist – through which I evaluate the EU’s global strategy. The research shows that while the EU aims to strengthen its relative economic power as well as to build up militarily usable technologies, their strength is still moderated and arbitrated through the normative identity of the EU that deflects the external pressures. Additionally, I also show that the expectation that the EU will double down on norms, its normative approach may be challenged even as norms are intertwined with relative gains concerns to manage policy adjustments within the EU that from both normative and realist perspective look suboptimal.

For the purpose of this research, online interviews were conducted with ten Chinese citizens who spent at least one semester of their studies abroad. The assumption was that if the new generation elite in China, the most powerful competitor of the United States in the international arena, is indeed hybridized and more prone to liberal democracy, then the liberal international order has potential to remain in power. The empirical results have indicated at least some form of hybridization among all interviewees and their aspiration for certain elements of the liberal culture. The most popular elements of liberal culture were development of critical thinking, aspiration for work-life balance, exposure to other sources of media, setting personal boundaries and becoming “green”.

It attempts to redress the long-standing debate about whether China is a threat or not in engaging the Western Balkans. I will argue that China's purpose in constructing its normative power is to struggle for other countries' recognition of its key practices in external relations and ensure the domestic legitimacy of the Communist Party of China. History factors shape China's current foreign policy thinking, and these factors have been transformed into current forms. Therefore, China has to struggle for other countries' recognition of its political and economic models, human rights narratives, and the One-China and non-interference principles. All in all, China concerns its domestic sustainable economic growth, sovereignty issues related to national reunification, and nationalism, instead of rebuilding the international order or even seeking hegemony. The extent to which the Western Balkan countries accept these three norms determines whether China could be considered a normative power in the Western Balkans.  Wendt's approach contributes to understanding China's participation in the Western Balkans in terms of sovereign practice, cooperation, and (internal and external) legitimacy. After China successfully internalized its sovereignty, China became more respectful of other's territorial rights. At the same time, China recognizes that its sovereignty depends on the recognition of others. Moreover, both internal and external legitimacy has to struggle for recognition. The Communist Party of China needs to maintain sustained economic growth and territorial sovereignty and oppose external interference in Chinese affairs in order to legitimize its one-party rule. Externally, China has put forward the slogans like 'peace and development' and 'The community with a shared future for all mankind' to build China's external legitimacy."", 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (578k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The importance to elaborate on North-South RTAs is motivated by the idea that there might be more agreements with a mixed membership in the upcoming years, since the world is experiencing the rise of developing economies. However, the literature about the integration processes of the Global North-South countries is not as wide as the one related to North-North or South-South agreements. Because of that, it is necessary to explain that developing countries present less development than their partners when they join in an RTA; thus, they experience asymmetries, resulting in different outcomes. To elaborate on that, this thesis contributes to the current literature and scholarly projects, especially to the Krapohl and Fink classification of integration processes, taking the North America Free Trade Agreement as the studied region and Mexico as the test case. This thesis argues that there is a type of integration between developed and developing countries, where the developing state achieves its economic purposes and develop specific institutions and virtues based on the interaction with its developed partners. To explain that, this project creates a model of three outcomes composed by data that explain economic, bureaucratic and institutional, and social outcomes. It is possible that developing countries will present data from the three outcomes; however, one of them will be more abundant. Finally, I propose a classification of three scenarios based on the outcomes, arguing that, even when the RTA generates negative social impacts, the developing member will be part of it because of the more positive benefits in its economy or bureaucracy and institutions.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (689k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

As it was originally formulated, securitization scholars highlighted how our understanding of security is socially constructed and analyzed various speech acts through which securitizing actors try to acquire the assent of a relevant audience for the adoption of extraordinary measures. Yet, it has been argued that this specific framework has its limitations. In this thesis, I focus on three blind spots, which are embedded in the theory’s focus on speech, the politics of exception, and the under-developed concept of the audience. In contrast, this thesis seeks to put forward an understanding of securitization that draws on the insights from the so-called aesthetic turn in international relations. First, instead of speech, I focus on politics as multisensory. Second, instead of the language of urgency and extraordinary measures, I focus on popular culture seen as part of the politics of the everyday. Third, instead of assuming securitizing actors and audiences as established categories, I analyze how they were performed into being. Instead of asking: how do security problems emerge? I elaborate on the question: how do securitizing actors emerge? I argue that once securitizing actors acquire the legitimacy to speak on security issues, they have already gained a privileged position in the intersubjective field of power. I contend that we must consider the (everyday) politics of becoming a securitizing actor as a multisensory performance, and as part of the process of securitization. I then outline possible ways of conducting such analysis on the case study of Donald Trump’s performance in the reality TV show The Apprentice.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (642k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Exploring and making sense of how the lived experiences of the occupation, as a nuanced and reflected way of grasping the political world we inhabit and co-constitute, the present thesis contributes to questions of possibilities to alternative lives to be lived in space-taking forms of political dissent.

Therefore, I interview nine occupiers from #OccupyKossuth and craft a collective narrative of the occupation, which renders the internal social processes more precisely tangible. I conclude that the transformation of lived experiences of #OccupyKossuth allows for seeing practices of the protest as radically enacted alternatives to the current neoliberal hegemonic power structure, thus contesting them.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (547k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I argue that regionalism may serve well as a stumbling block for a country aiming to join an international organization while strategic geopolitical aspirations of a regional hegemon should also be taken into account.

The fact that the majority of the South Ossetian residents possessed Russian citizenship, which most of them acquired just few weeks before the outbreak of the war, served as the main justification for Russia to militarily intervene South Ossetia and subsequently even to mainland Georgia in order to protect its de jure citizens in the unrecognised republic. Passportisation is regarded by nationalism literature as one of several instruments of kin-state politics that the regional hegemons employ in order to support the rights and the status of their ethnic minorities abroad. I argue though that in the cases of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, of Donbas, Russia�s passportisation policies were initiated and shaped mostly by Russia�s concerns over its own territorial integrity, the probability that a de facto state would be re-captured by its former domestic homeland, and the geographical proximity, respectively the possibility of open military access to the unrecognised territory. The thesis will also introduce the reader into the discourse over Russia�s identity concepts which undoubtedly shaped also Russia�s citizenship policies. Paradoxically, Russia�s geopolitical goals contradicted its own domestic discourse, what is properly reflected even in the Kremlin�s decision to distribute its passports to unrecognised states in large quantities despite the anti-immigration sentiment of the Russian public provoked by two Chechnyan wars in the late 1990s and early 2000s.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1648k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In 1945, the Soviet Union declared sovereignty over the then-Japanese islands following Japan’s surrender in the Second World War. However, Japan argues that Russia, the successor state to the Soviet Union, has illegitimate grounds for claiming the Southern Kurils and demands a handover of the islands. The thesis applies three analytical lenses to understand why the dispute has yet to be resolved, despite the Russian and Japanese governments’ numerous efforts to establish a formal settlement. The thesis first uses neoclassical realism to examine the material and structural dimensions of the dispute, and then utilizes ontological security to determine how national identity, both internally derived and externally projected, influences Russia and Japan’s positions toward the Southern Kurils. Although neoclassical realism and ontological security illuminate certain aspects of the case, the thesis applies two-level games to fill in the gaps that the other theories do not fully account for. The two-level games framework links domestic influences to Russia and Japan’s policies at the international level, which helps clarify why Russia and Japan continue to hold bilateral negotiations over the Southern Kurils, even though there are strong domestic disincentives for both countries to resolve the dispute.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (688k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This research finds that in addition to Reicherâ€™s pre-conditions, for the resolution to be convoked, it must be in the interest of maintaining international peace and security to do so, it must be established that it does not run contrary to any of the provisions of the UN Charter, it does not threaten the interest(s) of the Permanent Members of the Security Council and the resolution itself is still very useful and has not been made redundant by some institutional or procedural mechanism within the United Nations architecture.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (353k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Unexpectedly, despite the historical tendency of the French state to protect its domestic firms from foreign takeover, not only are the French policymakers less willing to intervene, they are also supporting mergers with European competitors by using a European patriotic discourse. By mapping the public debate surrounding these cases, we explain why the majority of political actors supported these mergers, by using, with more or less emphasis, a European rhetoric. Namely, the main findings of this contribution reveal a strategic, if not an opportunistic usage of a European rhetoric by French policy makers. Europe is referred to as a new patrie only when French companies are taken over by other European competitors. To legitimize what might be perceived as a loss, French political actors use a European patriotic discourse, with a special emphasis on the idea of “European champion”.

In order to conduct this analysis, I will be looking at the case of Georgia and comparing it to other post-Soviet States. More specifically, this paper will examine how the Western oriented autocratic governance of the United National Movement (UNM) party in Georgia, from 2003 to 2012, improved the country’s economic and political performance, in addition to increasing the pro-Western attitude in the Georgian society. Previous literature on the topic of what type of governance is best for undeveloped states is mostly in support of democracy, rather than autocracy, while those justifying autocratic governance don’t talk about how it can increase the pro-Western attitude in societies. By comparing Georgia to other non-European Post Soviet States, mainly Armenia and Azerbaijan, this paper finds evidence that the Western oriented autocratic governance of the UNM party was beneficial for Georgia and has potential implications for other undeveloped countries as well. The first finding of this paper is that the various policies enacted by the UNM party, combined with their general approach towards ruling the country, could potentially be beneficial for improving the economic and political situation if applied to any undeveloped state. Second finding is that, while the method used by the UNM for promoting pro-Western attitude can be used for other Post Soviet States, it might not work for most undeveloped states, as the UNM’s approach relied heavily on anti-Russian propaganda in the promotion of a pro-Western attitude within the society.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (726k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

State sponsorship of rebel organizations is less costly than a direct military intervention, but rebels often defy orders, desert fighting or turn guns against their sponsors. Under what conditions do rebels turn against their sponsors? Drawing on principal-agent and organizational theories, I argue that the non-centralized structure of rebel organizations increases the length of delegation chain from sponsors to rebels, leading to defection. Non-centralized organizations have weak central leadership that is unable to control, monitor or punish its rank and file. Due to this disadvantage, non-centralized rebel organizations are less accountable to their sponsors, cannot credibly commit to rapidly change their policies in response to shifts in the sponsor’s demands and suffer from frequent and destructive quarrels between the top and lower echelons. My argument is tested through the statistical analysis of a novel dataset on Sponsorship of Rebels (SOR), and the case study of Pakistan’s sponsorship of Kashmiri militants, 1989-2004. I find support for my argument that non-centralized organizations are likely to defect against their sponsors. Likewise the model demonstrates that shared ethnic ties, weak rebels and the existence of transnational support are associated with defection.

Yet, a discourse on great powers has recently made a comeback in response to the rising power of states whose compatibility with that order is in doubt. According to this language of ʻresponsible power’ or ʻresponsible great power’ – present both in the discourse of the practitioners of international politics and in academic literature – growing power comes with correspondingly increasing and special responsibilities set by the international social order, and it is meeting these latter that secures a state legitimate great power status. The equivalence between greatness and responsibility, however, is paradoxical if the latter stands for accountability for the fulfilment of obligations. Such an understanding of responsibility is fully internal to a pre-given structure of order with its norms, social and functional roles, and criteria of legitimacy. The assertion of greatness, on the other hand, requires an actor to reveal itself outside any pre-given standard, and to have its own standards recognised as equal – hence the historical centrality of war to claiming great powerhood. Asserting one's greatness by fulfilling the required responsibilities therefore seems paradoxical. The dissertation argues that despite this paradoxical relationship the discourses of great powerhood and responsibility have in fact been reconciled historically in diverse ways, but that in order to see this, we need to move away from an exclusive focus on responsibility modelled on obligations and we need to include into our account the concept of responsibility as a character trait or disposition. The dissertation examines, in a genealogical manner, how this concept of being responsible has come to occupy a fundamental position in modern understandings of social order and how it became a crucial element in re-articulating the concepts of great powerhood and great power management detached from the European legal and spatial order in relation to which they were originally defined. In three case studies – Sino-British relations in the early 19th century; Washington's opening to China in 1969; and the European Union's invitation of China as a partner in administering African development – the dissertation offers contributions to a genealogy of great powers and responsibility by focusing on how China was understood in the light of Western conceptions of governing the world. The developments traced in these case studies indicate that while the liberal international order might not allow for great power authority, it can still be compatible with a practice of great power management articulated in terms of a neoliberal art of administering the world."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (5448k)'}"

It argues that contrary to the original objectives, transnational regulatory convergence in these two policy fields has reinforced rather than mitigated internal economic disparities in the Eastern members of the European Union (EU). The project emphasizes the role of the complex interactions between the EU, multinational investors and central governments in determining uneven territorial development in a gradually converging regulatory environment. In this respect, it challenges the propositions of those mainstream theories that attribute the presence of spatial divergence in capitalist economies merely to the regional diversity in endowments. The research extends to the four Visegrad countries (V4), which, while structurally rather similar to each other, introduced different investment and regional development policies in the 1990s, only to later converge on European rules as a consequence of regulatory integration within the EU. The implications of these mechanisms for regional disparities are demonstrated on two different outcomes. On the one hand, the analysis finds that subsidized foreign direct investment (FDI) has primarily entered the relatively well-developed NUTS 3 regions while leaving the most backward areas virtually void of FDI. On the other hand, this work brings ample empirical evidence in support of the argument that the spatial distribution of the EU’s Structural Funds failed to reduce inter-regional disparities but contributed to the rise in intra-regional inequality.  The reason for these puzzling outcomes rests in the uniform application of EU regulations to the Visegrad as well as to other ECE countries. Instead of differentiating among the regions based on their internal developmental positions, the EU applied a European benchmark when setting both the regional state aid ceilings and the criteria for fund eligibility. Compared to EU standards, all the ECE regions qualify as backward thus neither state aid limits nor the criteria for receiving EU funds distinguished sufficiently among the more prosperous and the less advanced regions. This regulatory gap generated an unequal competition which proved advantageous for the more developed regions both in terms of securing foreign investments and EU funds.  Regarding FDI, the level playing field in regional state aid ceilings increased the already superior bargaining position of transnational companies (TNCs) over central governments, while the latter were being engaged in a fierce investment competition. In the end, TNCs managed to play off these states against each other and maximized their benefits by entering the most prosperous regions with the best endowments while also obtaining generous investment incentives for their projects. In terms of securing EU funds, uniform eligibility placed the more developed regions and localities in a better position relative to the backward ones. At the same time, the centralized fund management systems in ECE allowed the incumbents to allocate funds according to current political interests which did not necessarily supply the least prosperous regions and localities with more development grants.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (5483k)', 'Access': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer'}"

The driving question that inspires the research is the motivation of Romania to participate in, to contribute to, and to further cultivate the Euro-Atlantic partnership in light of its challenging security sector transformation post-Cold War. In the case of a newer EU member state such as Romania, the newly emerged national strategic culture practices and articulations need to be teased out so as to analyse the specific security profile of the country. The cases of Hungary and Poland are put forward so as to compare and contrast with the Romanian case the levels of adaptation and change in their national security strategy, under the influence of NATO and the CSDP during their post-Cold War transition.  Romania has seen the two international influences of NATO and the CSDP as complementary frameworks for enhanced national contribution to the Euro-Atlantic common security and defence. NATO has played the fundamental role of mentorship during Romania’s security sector reform, during and preceding and also continuing after its integration process in the Alliance. These security reforms have also been mirrored by the country’s involvement in the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), Romania using the CSDP framework to develop civilian capabilities and to participate in civilian-military operations.  The research goal is to map out the evolution and the inherent tensions triggered by the transformation of security professionals’ habituses from the outdated Cold-War representations to more modern understandings of security production and international projection under the joint tutorship of NATO and the CSDP. The research gives valuable insights of Romania’s security policy change by focusing on the processes of domestic transformation, resistance and professionalization in the field of security and defence.  In doing so, the thesis reconstructs Romania security profile from the perspective of Romanian security practitioners’ habituses as revealed in interviews and it traces their levels of involvement in shaping the country’s national attitude towards the Euro-Atlantic partnership. The research reveals that there have been tensions and hysteresis effects in such practitioners’ normative attitudes as regards the processes of professionalization and change in the post-Cold War Romanian security field.  The thesis operates under the proposition that in a transitional security context, when formal structures and rationalizations of strategic action are under construction or in question, security practitioners rely on a practical substrate to guide their actions. The present research advances to cross-cut the practice-oriented scholarship of Pierre Bourdieu with the broader debates on Europeanization and strategic culture, but it also moves beyond Bourdieu’s conceptual understanding of the habitus.  The research proposes the original concept of the transitional security habitus to best describe the fluid character of the Romanian security habitus and the constantly fluctuating security practices during transitional stages under multiple security policy reforms. The transitional security habitus best captures the idiosyncratic character of post-communist Romania’s security policy transition – adaptation to change and adjustments in the security habitus become ingrained habitual dispositions, embodied by security actors as social “survival” tools; it reflects the struggles encountered by security practitioners during changing security context, fluid security practices, and international professionalization prerequisites.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2236k)', 'Local note': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

These regionalist endeavors have produced outcomes like the Union for the Mediterranean, but have also resulted in the emergence of a Euro-Mediterranean sphere of non-state organizations. Previous research on these types of organizations, particularly foreign policy research, has largely addressed them as tools of EU-driven regionalism. This leaves open the question of why and how non-state organizations position themselves towards the concept of a Euro-Mediterranean region, and to what extent they become political actors at the regional level. In reaction, the present study approaches the Euro-Med as a hybrid political region characterized by internal heterogeneity, institutional volatility, and political polycentricity. Based on neo-functionalist hypotheses and assisted by insight from New Regionalism approaches, it argues that Euro-Mediterranean regionalism allows non-state organizations like NGOs, business associations, or networks of local authorities to (re-)orient towards Euro-Mediterranean regional politics. Empirical research to support this point relies on two comprehensive surveys, of non-state organizations and of regional inter-state contexts, as well as on case studies sustained by document analysis, stakeholder interviews and event observation. Findings indicate how regionalism has unleashed a wide range of Euro-Mediterranean non-state dynamics, including by advocacy groups of a pro-integration character, and illustrate the possibility and fruitfulness of applying neo-functionalist integration theory to the non-state field of hybrid macro-regions.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2480k)'}"

It discusses the short-term economic goals and long-term institutional effects of international rules on domestic politics of small states. A central concept is the concept of authority in hierarchical relations as defined by Lake, 2009. Authority is granted by the small state in the course of interaction with the hegemonic state, but authority is also utilized by the latter in order to attract small partners and to create positive expectations from cooperation. The main research question is how do small states trade their own authority for economic gains in relations with foreign governments and with local actors. This question is about the relationship between international and domestic hierarchies and the structural continuities that result from international cooperation. The contested relationship between foreign authority and domestic institutions is examined through the experience of Bulgaria under two different international trade regimes – the German economic sphere in the 1930’s and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) in the early 1950’s. These are two very restrictive regimes of administered domestic economies and bilateral clearing international trade. Both core countries of these regimes extend economic benefits to the small states in order to legitimize their rule and build international authority. The Nazi and the Soviet regimes relied on authority to a different extent and used it at different points in time to legitimize their power. Nazi Germany used soft power in the early 1930’s to attract economic cooperation, which evolved to hard power and economic exploitation during WWII. Soviet power at the end of WWII was in the form of military occupation and economic exploitation and gradually took a softer form including economic concessions to its sphere of influence. In both cases the small state had a certain degree of authority and was able to extract short term economic benefits from cooperation with the hegemon.

What motivates such changes and what are the primary actors and factors that make groups have a certain mapping perception and when virtual shifts occur? This broad and general question is broken down into two empirical and specific questions: (1) how the understanding of the Albanian nation takes on different geographical borders over time--with some periods associated with the Albanian nation mapping onto Albania\'s state borders and other periods the Albanian nation expanding on the broader concept of ""Greater Albania"", and (2) why different Albanian communities (in Albania in one hand and Macedonia and Kosovo on the other) have often imagined the borders of the Albanian nation differently at the same point in time? This dissertation, builds on the argument that power struggle between ‘internal’ and ‘external’ (diasporic) elites plays the primary role in building political agendas that create national borders. I construct here a theoretical model that captures the dynamics of domestic versus international constraints on elite choices and how this leads to (re)construction of borders. This builds on the logic that the elites engineer and manipulate national(ist) symbols to create the necessary environment for personal political gains, which is mainly getting and retaining political power. In other words, these competing elites use expansionist/contractionary versions of national map and imagined virtual borders that may or may not be congruent with internationally recognized ones. In embracing one or the other map project, such elites, through cost-benefit calculations, are always constrained by external pressures, which conditionalize domestic discourse and place limits their on their actions and how it influences map weaving. Although the primarily case is the Albanian case, studied comparatively in both spatial and temporal dimensions, as well as investigating compatibility/differences in mass and elite discourse and actions, the references include many empirical bits from a multitude of cases.

It argues that the Parliament plays a dual role: an institutional role through which it exerts parliamentary control over the EU’s CFSP actors; and an international role through which it engages directly with the outside world through parliamentary diplomacy. By examining two instances of the EU’s relations with actors of contested sovereignty in its neighborhood (Kosovo and the Palestinian Territories), the dissertation finds that the EP played different institutional roles in each. In the case of Kosovo, it tried to influence other EU actors by behaving as a precedent-setter, trying to instill the norm of Kosovo’s sovereignty in EU structures. In the case of the Palestinian territories, the EP acted as a public debate forum, providing a space for contesting views about EU policies towards the Hamas-led government, without reaching a consensus on a policy preference.  At the same time, the Parliament showed a coherent international role conception over both of these cases of contested sovereignty: that of a normative power. This normative understanding of the EU’s role in the world leads the EP to approach foreign policy issues through the prism of promoting fundamental democratic rights. Most importantly, the Parliament’s institutional and international role performances are mutually reinforcing. The ability of the EP to conduct parliamentary diplomacy is useful in its parliamentary control functions over CFSP actors, while its democratic oversight of the EU’s foreign policy is what gives the EU the international legitimacy to act as a normative power in the world.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1766k)', 'Access': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer'}"

Theories within political economy persistently renegotiate the relative influence of forces of globalization, history, and politics. This research relies on these extensive theories about the influence of international forces and historical legacies, but positions those factors as pressures that must be mediated by political agency and therefore contributes to the ‘politics matters’ hypothesis. In order to refine the models of welfare politics, I propose three alternative political mechanisms producing welfare state change. First, governments with high socio-economic ideological coherence are more likely to pass reform. Second, reform under non-coherent governments occurs only when technocrats use tactical approaches to build consensus for retrenchment. Finally, passive measures for welfare state change, which are less visible adjustments to the generosity of benefits, such as adjustments to benefit indexation, are applied even by governments that cannot pass reform and these can incrementally, but significantly redefine social policy instruments. This framework is evaluated through detailed case study analysis of welfare politics across four countries – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia – and three policy areas – pension, family, and unemployment policy – between 1990-2012. To complement the case studies, I develop indicators to measure the degree of welfare state change, including ones that capture the use of passive measures. Then I assess the findings across the policy areas and explain the absence of clear welfare state typologies. The contributions of this work include refining theories of welfare politics by incorporating a thus far neglected variable: government coherence. By testing it on postcommunist ECE welfare states and engaging with literature from Western European welfare states, the resulting framework has potential to explain welfare state development both in and beyond the more commonly studied advanced economies. Another contribution of this research is the advancement of tools for measuring passive change and investigating the reasons behind the prevalent use of ‘passive austerity’ as an alternative to more visible welfare state retrenchment.

By studying the case of Roma, the normative relevance of different transnational attachments is analysed including transnational political and civic solidarities, trans-border ethnic and national attachments, as well as hybrid and diasporic identities. Such analyses lead to more fundamental questions about the relation of political action and solidarity to self-determination, citizenship, and territoriality. The study finds that the emergence of transnational solidarities in itself is not sufficient for the emergence of transnational forms of democracy. Trans-state forms of democratic solidarity have to be coupled with a capacity of authoritative self-rule in order for transnational forms of democracy to take root. The dissertation refutes both state-centric and global visions of democracy, as well as ethnic-neutral and nationalist conceptions, and argues for a difference-respecting trans-state approach that recognizes we are members of overlapping and nested polities, appreciates cultural diversity, but does not seek to accommodate it within nation-states. The thesis embraces a dynamic and open conception of culture that leaves room for multiple identities, voices of dissent and experimentation, as well as voluntary assimilation.  The dissertation exposes the proliferation of citizenship regimes as citizenship, nationality, and residency are increasingly detached; however, these developments in themselves are not sufficient for the emergence of transnational forms of democracy. On the contrary, by studying the case of Roma, the thesis identifies three dimensions of exclusion: ethnic stigmatization, social exclusion, and denial of citizenship. These forms of exclusion may reinforce each other and push the racialized poor and the racialized stranger to the margins of the polis.  Concerning the case of Roma, the dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis of the genesis of 'Roma issue' in international politics; develops a normative framework for studying options of state-bounded and trans-state forms of Romani political participation embracing both electoral and non-electoral forms; and situates Romani claims amongst those advanced by other trans-state and stateless nations including diasporas, immigrant and non-territorial communities. The dissertation argues that Romani self-determination (in the form of cultural autonomy) cannot substitute for effective anti-discrimination measures and the consolidation of democratic solidarity.  The study finds that the political participation of Romani citizens on the basis of formal political equality is not adequate, therefore special political rights may be accorded to them on both national and European levels for instance in the form of quotas or reserved seats. The thesis rejects the general vision of deterritorialization of political communities, but embraces the possibility of developing supplementary forms of transnational autonomy of trans-border nations and diasporas, for instance within the framework of European Union.

Focusing on where the neoliberal urban order is contested, I approach practices of abandonment – the splintering of infrastructure and forced relocation – as coinciding with governmental technologies that render the poor unequal as political and/or economic subjects. Locating, to start, the epistemological conditions of abandonment in Michel Foucault’s rendering of liberalism as the framework of biopolitics, followed by a discussion of the spatial and juridical technologies of government that materialize the power to disallow life alongside discourses that distance the surplus population from the fostered (bio)political community, the first part of the thesis concentrates on the processes of rendering unequal. Turning, then, to the disruption of this order, I present Abahlali’s politics as a three-fold politics of proximity. I argue that in constructing their politics as 1) a space of speaking and listening, 2) a form of knowledge that maintains the shack-dweller as the subject and the knower of politics, and 3) a legal struggle to claim their place in the city, Abahlali disrupts the biopower that lets die.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1368k)', 'Local note': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The thesis argues that development failures in SSA are inherently linked to donors’ misunderstanding of partner states. Equally important, this thesis claims that development failures are connected to donors’ incapacity to connect to local SSA governance and social realities. The puzzle is not only that there is an evident mismatch between donor policies and local social realities, but as well that western donors appear to be incapable of understanding SSA governance and social realties while claiming to sustain their development. An interpretive research design has been employed for uncovering the perceptions and beliefs of policy-makers and non-governmental organizations (NGO) employees involved in EDF-related processes. The findings show that the European EDF policy-makers, while being responsible for designing development policies, encounter substantive difficulties in understanding the way partner governments and more broadly SSA states and societies function. Therefore, the thesis explores the EDF policy-makers’ lack of understanding of SSA states and societies, in an attempt to uncover its implications for international relations theory and development policy. In more detail, building partially on the previous literature, the thesis looks into the implications of lack of empirical sovereignty of SSA states for statebuilding and development efforts. The thesis shows that SSA states continue to be seen as states by western donors because of the incapacity to observe and translate at a policy level the meanings-in-use that state-like institutions acquire within the local socio-cultural contexts in SSA. On a conceptual level, the thesis claims that the centrality of western understandings of statehood, while making all other forms of governance irrelevant, obscures furthermore our capacity to conceptualize and run analysis beyond the theoretical boundaries of western statehood, leading to policy incoherence. The thesis aims to empirically illustrate discrepancies between western conceptions of statehood- and development-related practices and SSA experiences. It does so through a single case study research design analyzing the perceptions of policy-makers and NGO employees involved in EDF-related interactions. A specific focus is shed on the negotiations carried out between the European Commission and SSA governments. Based on 76 interviews, carried out in Brussels, Burundi, Kenya, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda, the empirical analysis reveals the perception of substantial inconsistencies and discrepancies between various meanings attributed to development and state-related norms, institutions, and practices. The thesis shows how the discrepancies observed at an operational-policy level are connected to discrepancies at a general conceptual level and how both such discrepancies are partially determined by the western ethnocentricity of the conceptual frameworks underpinning EU development policies.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (3119k)', 'Local note': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

It addresses the question of why there has been a substantial variation in the degree of labor migration between CEE countries with very similar wage levels and living standards and the West – with high rates of migration from the Baltic countries, Poland, and Slovakia and lower rates among the workers from the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia. The dissertation makes a strong case that economic factors alone, as proposed in the neoclassical framework, fail to explain the diverse migration patterns across the CEE countries. Through analyzing CEE migration patterns in the context of the complex economic and social changes that the countries experienced during the transition from socialism to market economies, this dissertation builds a conceptually more accurate and empirically valid model. The research framework tests two factors that were excluded from the studies that estimated the expected migration flows from CEE prior to the enlargement: the impact of structural change and the role of welfare systems and state policies. These variables are analyzed in a framework that compares across countries and over time, but are also tied closely to two migrant profiles which capture two types of CEE migration over time. The empirical analyses show, first, that the pressures of economic change were distributed unevenly across countries and across populations within them and therefore induced some types of workers to seek migration as an exit option more than others, producing different occupational profiles of migrants across countries and generating different rates of migration. Second, the countries with less generous welfare states faced higher shares of their workers leaving to work abroad. In sum, I find that the CEE countries in which the opportunity structures have been more extensive, generated either by economic structures that are more favorable to the skill set and the preferences of its human capital and/or generous welfare policies, experienced lower out-migration rates. This interdisciplinary work contributes to the theories of migration and speaks directly to the most recent studies that have called to analyze migration as part of broader global processes and social change. The thesis carries out systematic comparative cross-national over time research about migrant sending countries and makes important steps in developing new ways of analyzing home countries’ role in affecting migration.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1242k)', 'Access': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer'}"

The latter determines the short- and medium-run determinants of the current account balances in two eras of globalization. The results of Chapter 5 suggest that the transitory shocks to income are the main source of variation in the trade balance, whereas the permanent shocks to income determine the changes in the income. Thus, in the short-run it is possible to increase the current account balance by fiscal or monetary tightening. Chapter 6 investigates the determinants of the current account balances for 14 countries in the period of 1865-1913 and 107 countries for the period of 1970-2007. The comparison has yielded several similarities. In both periods, the excess saving was redistributed to relatively rich countries with developed financial markets, high quality institutions and high proportion of dependent persons in the population. Second, the results suggest that the global savings glut and the twin deficits hypothesis are not mutually exclusive.

Since apologies for historical wrongs are often argued to be conducive to national and international reconciliation, thereby improving relations and contributing to lasting peace, the study examines why states sometimes refuse to apologize nevertheless, even when it is in their material interest to do so. This study argues that, unlike diplomatic apologies, state apologies for historical wrongs involve an expansion of state responsibility and require changes in state identity. Demands for historical apologies thus serve to not only to affirm the validity of the violated norms but also to challenge the state's view of itself. Such challenges may come from and thus influence state identity construction at three levels: domestic, bilateral and transnational. This study argues that states refuse to apologize when apologizing would significantly disrupt their self-narratives and thus threaten their ontological security. In support of these arguments, three cases are examined: the so-called Danish cartoon crisis in 2006, Lithuania's demands for Russia to compensate the damage of the Soviet occupation, and the transnational demands for Turkey to recognize the Armenian genocide. The three cases illustrate how ontological security concerns mediate the content and the scope of international norms by means of ascription, acceptance or rejection of responsibility. The study suggests that historical apologies take the practice of state apologies beyond the traditional framework of international law and, insofar as they require not merely adjusting or coordinating behavior but also rewriting self-narratives, they can also become sources of conflict, rather than a means for conflict resolution."", 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1161k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The discussion is placed within the poststructuralist theoretical framework that stresses identity-constitutive effects of foreign policy discourses and, more broadly, attempts to problematize the sedimentation of the social with the help of the political. In particular, different versions of the ‘geopolitics’/’Eurasianism’ constellation are analyzed from the point of view of how well they address the problem of European hegemony in the Russian political discourse and conceptualize post-Soviet Russia’s political subjectivity. The study thus draws a comparison between two discourses on ‘geopolitics’/’Eurasianism’ – the ‘pragmatic’ nationalist discourse advocated by Russian foreign-policy makers, and ‘civilizational’ geopolitical discourse critical of the official coupling of ‘geopolitics’ and ‘Eurasianism’. Thus, the research question and, at the same time, the puzzle that informs the dissertation is why – why did post-Soviet Russia witness a rise of ‘civilizational’ geopolitics that proceeded by way of revisiting both classical geopolitics and classical Eurasianism?', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD'}"

The single market requires regulatory integration, understood as the adoption of a single set of harmonized EU rules and their consistent implementation across all EU countries. Regulatory integration is essentially an institutional change from multiple national regulatory frameworks towards a single EU framework. This process is complicated by several obstacles: conflicting policy preferences of member states for important aspects of EU financial regulations, supermajoritarian EU decision-making requirements, as well as member states' control over implementation of EU rules. The EU addresses these complications by delegating regulatory powers to technocratic committees, leading to the question of whether and how this delegation of power enhances regulatory integration. The three strands of new institutionalist literature in political science suggest alternative causal mechanisms that could account for effects of delegation on regulatory integration. The historical institutionalist explanation relies on reinterpretation, and the sociological one is based on deliberation and the rationalist one relies on bargaining. Each of these explanations implies different patterns of policy compromises: hence their relative explanatory power can be empirically tested. The thesis concludes that the evidence from three longitudinal case studies of EU regulations of bank capital, investment services, and cross-border bank resolution is most consistent with the rationalist explanation of institutional change. The delegation of regulatory powers to autonomous, but accountable committees reduces the transaction costs of EU policy making, enabling committees to propose and monitor more complex and more harmonized package deals than was possible before the delegation. Although these committees can enhance regulatory integration of even the most politically contested aspects of EU financial regulations, their effects are limited and provide no substitute for difficult political choices about the most appropriate rules for the single market in financial services."", 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1732k)', 'Access': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer'}"

While Slovenia claimed to seek independence mainly on economic grounds, in Croatia, historical and ethno-nationalist arguments dominated the discourse on independence. Economic arguments played a prominent role also in Montenegro during mobilization where, however, a reformist, pro-democracy rhetoric became the most salient. The question arises why in some cases of self-determination elites push for a higher level of sovereignty in the name of economic advancement, whereas in other cases, self-determination movements refer to ethnic identity, human rights issues and other kind of rationale. Therefore, this dissertation specifically asks why some movements are framed by certain types of arguments and not by others. Why did the Montenegrin independence movement rely so heavily on a pro-democracy rhetoric and why did economic arguments become so central in Slovenia? How can it be explained that in Croatia ethno-nationalist themes dominated while references to economic reasons remained marginal? This study is based on the assumption that framing influences inter-ethnic dynamics during the course of a self-determination movement in a multi-ethnic setting. While mobilization centered on ethnicity tend to exclude minorities from the national community, by contrast movements employing economic or pro-democracy arguments tend to express claims with reference to a territorial unit not to an ethnic group. Thus they are less likely to alienate minorities than so called “primordialist nationalist” arguments referring to ethnic identity. Consequently, it can be argued that a relevant aspect distinguishing mobilization discourses from each other is whether they define collective identity in ethnically inclusive or exclusive way. By studying the Slovenian, the Croatian and the Montenegrin independence movement, the goal of this study is to explain how and why certain discourses come to dominate some independence movements and not others. Thus the present dissertation aims to shed light on the dynamics of secessionist framing, that is how politicians interpret events and present arguments with the intention to mobilize their constituencies for independence.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

It examines the dynamics of EU interventions in conflicts, asking: Why and under what conditions does the EU decide to get involved in conflict resolution? In a conflict-prone world and competing security priorities, what determines EU involvement in particular conflicts? Do supranational institutions, such as the European Commission and the EU Council Secretariat, matter in initiating, shaping and implementing EU policies on conflict resolution? To answer these questions, I use institutionalist and intergovernmentalist theories to assess their relative explanatory power in accounting for the patterns of EU interventions in conflict. I find that these approaches are broadly complementary: institutionalism explains EU interventions in the low-politics areas of conflict resolution, while intergovernmentalism explains EU behaviour in the high-politics areas of intervention. When it comes to intervention in conflicts, EU foreign policy is like a light airplane: it can fly without being caught on radar as long as it flies ‘low’. By flying low (and slow), such an airplane can advance quite far into ‘enemy’ territory. However, if it increases its altitude above a certain threshold, it risks being detected by radars, and actions may be taken to halt the aircraft. The same holds true for EU interventions in conflicts. To avoid challenging EU member states, EU institutions often employ stealth intervention, operating predominantly in uncontroversial and depoliticised aspects of conflict resolution. By “flying low,” they are thus able to gradually extend their mandate from low-politics areas of conflict resolution to the high politics realm of overt intervention. Using a strategy I call “dosage”, EU institutions engage in a series of low-cost actions, which, over a longer period of time, can yield significant cumulated policy impact. However, if their involvement becomes suddenly controversial, as when EU institutions enter suddenly into the realm of high-politics, EU member states may move to limit their autonomy.  The dissertation traces the politics of stealth intervention by EU institutions using unpublished empirical data related to the EU decision-making process as well as interactions between the EU institutions, EU member states, and Russia in the conflict zones in question.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (306k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Despite this reality, the group continues experiencing exclusion from various aspects of life including employment. The past three decades however have illuminated positive changes to address the plight of PWDs through different mechanisms. Anti-discrimination laws are one of such mechanisms that have become the most appropriate tools in tackling discrimination in all spheres of life for PWDS including employment. Ethiopia has also been engaged in reforming its laws to make in line with changing conditions. One of the changes made is the enactment of Proclamation No. 568/2008 designed to realize equal opportunity of PWDs in employment. The proclamation has actually introduced vital transformations such as the obligation of reasonable accommodation, equality with its substantive context, prohibition of discrimination with its different forms, shifting burden of proof, setting up enforcement mechanism as well as provision of sanctions and remedies to the violation of right in the proclamation. In fact, mere enactment or existence of laws does not serve to achieve the purpose for which they are sought. Proclamation 568/2008 cannot escape from this assertion. The sanction against the employers is not sufficient to effectively tackle the prevalence of discrimination at work place; since the fine against the employers is minimal which would invite employers to make cost-benefit analysis of the punishment. If cost of reasonable accommodation is higher than the sanction, there is a tendency to pay the punishment rather than providing reasonable accommodation. Thus, the penalty has to be revised to embrace deterrence or dissuasiveness principle. If hiring assistant is an obligation upon the employer, which the law never wants to negotiate, the government also should share the burden through different schemes to increase employability of PWDs particularly in the private sector, which is not that much developed to facilitate such accommodation in Ethiopiaâ€™s case. Furthermore, the proclamation recognizes that discriminated job applicants with disabilities can be represented before the court of law by means of their association to which they associate. Fund restriction imposed by proclamation 621/2009 makes it more difficult the operation of association of PWDS. With respect to scope, the federal cassation division bench in the case of Teklu Mekkonenn v. Addis Ababa Justice Bureau ruled that appointees with disabilities could not bring a case by virtue of Proclamation 568/2008.

The proposal is viewed as part of an expanding array of mechanisms aimed at guaranteeing victims rights. I ground the proposal in an understanding of the goals of transitional justice, and the alternative measures available to meet these goals. Coming to a final verdict in an international criminal trial is an important step toward meeting transitional justice goals including the utilitarian and retributive goals achieved through ruling on liability, and symbolic justice for victims. In general, trial in absentia is viewed as acceptable by international and regional human rights courts if safeguards are met. Different international tribunals have approached trial in absentia with varying degrees of tolerance. This thesis examines international and regional standards surrounding trial in absentia, including case-law from the Human Rights Committee (HRC), International Criminal Court (ICC), International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and concludes that partial in absentia trials will likely continue to be permitted in international law. This thesis devotes a separate chapter to analysis of trial in absentia at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the Statutes of which explicitly allow for proceedings in the absence of the defendant. Despite the strong tradition dictating that a trial should end upon the death of defendant, legal theory and precedent shows that international criminal law allows for some procedural flexibility in favor victim’s rights, due to the gravity of international core crimes and the sui generis nature of international tribunals. In order to establish guidelines surrounding when flexibility can occur, this thesis examines international law in the frame of Packer’s two models, as well as the work of Damaska and Megrét, and case-law from the European Court of Human Rights. The thesis concludes by examining how trial in absentia—usually resulting from the flight of the defendant, the defendant’s refusal to appear at his or her trial, the defendant’s disruption of the courtroom, or serious medical needs of the defendant—can apply to cases where the defendant has died, without violating human rights norms. This thesis ultimately advocates for the adoption of a waiver system in which the defendant may agree to the continuation of his or her trial after death.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (666k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

With this end in mind, the thesis will comparatively study the procedures available at the United Nations, Inter-American and African Human rights systems for the adjudication of socio-economic rights. The thematic focus of the thesis is, particularly, tailored to assessment of state obligation in adjudication of individual cases and provision of effective remedies when violation is found, since they are the main areas to which challenges on judicial enforcement of socio-economic rights are associated. These thematic issues will be systematically analysed by reference to the case laws of the jurisdictions selected for this study and other relevant jurisdictions as the case may be.

The paper argues that the national legislations need to see involuntary placement and treatment as separate measures and the standards should differ accordingly. The fact that person is dangerous due to their mental health condition could be legitimate grounds for placement, however, long term involuntary treatment under any circumstances is unjustified, since it inherently violates personal autonomy and the principle of informed consent which is fundamental to medical world. The actions aimed at restoring person’s autonomy and stabilizing the critical situation at hand are justifiable as immediate emergency measures, and should be terminated at the point when the patient autonomy is restored.

Populists influence is becoming serious, but their politics is bringing worries. They are against diversity, pluralism, and multiculturalism. Besides that, populism is the new movement which takes advantage of political emotionalism. Therefore, a debate on the threats that populism poses on democracy is open. Coming to the question of the danger posed to democracy, this thesis connects populism and the theory of militant democracy as a concept which aims to protect the democratic system from enemies that want to destroy it. Hence, the thesis question is “does populism in politics pose a threat to democracy and if yes, can militant democracy measures be utilized to address or neutralize this threat.” In answering the thesis question, the thesis provides an analysis on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and case studies of Germany and Bulgaria. This thesis examines both, the theoretical and the practical application of the theory. The theoretical foundations are covered in the first chapter, whereas the chapter on the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence and the case studies of Germany and Bulgaria, provide an examination of the practical application of the concept. The concept of militant democracy in this thesis is connected to populism through a mix of legal and political approach. This presents on the one hand the political situation in the selected countries and on the other hand, the relevant constitutional and legal provisions and case law for addressing the question of populism.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1265k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

These three jurisdictions were selected for belonging to the Organization of American States, for shared borders and common colonial histories. The OAS encompasses the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, of which Canada is party to the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights and the United States is not. These commonalities, as well as the prevalence of legal disputes where resource development and extraction occurs on indigenous lands, shapes the jurisdiction choices for this thesis. Cases dealing with extractive industries and indigenous land rights were selected from high judicial authority within each jurisdiction and were analyzed through a theoretical framework consisting of settler colonialism and environmental racism. Cases selection is not restricted to Supreme Court rulings of Canada and the United States, however, as the lower level court decisions significantly impact upon particular indigenous communities who derive their rights from territorially specific treaties. This thesis concludes that, while legal principles that govern the Inter-American Court of Human Rights finds cases more favorably for indigenous petitioners.

About 25% of the worldâ€™s refugees come into being due to conflicts in Africa. The majority of these refugees find themselves in either Kenya or Ethiopia where they invariably end up in refugee camps. While refugee camps may be suitable to provide immediate assistance to refugees, when they evolve into long-term solutions, they end up creating conditions that amount to violations of human rights. In Kenya, the government has used national security concerns as a means to enforce strict encampment policies that have resulted in denying refugees basic human rights and that have exacerbated the protracted nature of the camps there. In Ethiopia, the approach is only slightly different. Camp situations are the norm, but the government routinely sets up new camps in order to alleviate the population pressure of existing ones. In addition, a few refugees are allowed to leave the refugee camps under an out of camp policy or to register as urban refugees. In these situations, refugees are able to lead independent and dignified lives. There are better outcomes for refugees when governments address the human rights violations that occur within refugee camps. Ultimately, it is better for both the refugees and the host country when refugees are allowed to move freely, to obtain documentation that allows them to work and to establish residences away from the refugee camps. The result is that the camp situations stop being the norm when it comes to refugee protection, but alternative durable solutions, such as local integration are embraced.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (945k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Under the Refugee Convention, these countries are internationally bound to respect the prohibition on refoulement, to provide persons seeking international protection access to asylum procedures, and to provide broader Convention rights to such persons who are subject to their jurisdiction and physically within their territories; the refugee protection frameworks in these countries have evolved in such a way as to be incompatible with these key obligations. As such, this Thesis then turns to the nature of the rhetoric employed in Australia, Hungary and the United States when discussing, promoting and justifying their policies and practices which are inconsistent with the Convention obligations, and then analyses this rhetoric by reference to the conceptual framework provided by the juncture of securitisation, majority identitarian populism and crimmigration. Australia, Hungary and the United States incontrovertibly violate their Convention obligations. While this thesis may provide an explanation for why these violations occur, it does not provide an answer for what happens as a consequence of these violations. While Hungary may face some consequences through the supranational legal framework of the European Union, it is unlikely that Australia and the United States will be held accountable in any meaningful way for their violations of the Convention. This demonstrates the limited force the Convention has as an instrument of international law, as it only has the power that signatory states ultimately decide to accord it through their laws and practices. Broadly, this has concerning ramifications for the future interpretation of the aforementioned key Convention obligations. While non-refoulement exists to prevent the return of persons seeking international protection in any manner whatsoever to countries where they may face harm that amounts to persecution, practices whereby access to territory is prevented and entry into territory is criminalised mean that these states can very easily refoule persons they are bound to protect. Where states are able to force refugees back to countries where they risk persecution, whether through directly deporting them to their countries of origin or indirectly forcing them to return through the cumulative effect of policies of denial and deterrence, the foundational protection of the Convention is fundamentally weakened.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (885k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

In this sense, whether awards which have been annulled in their country of origin can in spite of the annulment be enforced in other jurisdictions is the question which has been subject to various theoretical constructions from all sides of the spectrum – from those who adhere to the opinion that annulment deprives an award of any legal effect meaning that it is impossible to enforce it anywhere, over those in the middle who claim that the issue should be observed on a case-to-case basis and relevant surrounding circumstances which is why no single answer to the imposed question could or should be given, to those who strongly proclaim that enforcement of set-aside awards be allowed. Accordingly, the diversity of approaches has also been confirmed in practice, as on the basis of relevant case law it will be seen that courts of various jurisdictions have taken different positions towards the same issue – some of them have found set-aside awards to be enforceable, some of them, on the other hand, have sided with a contrary view. Based on this preliminary discussion, although it can easily be concluded that the subject is so diversified that no consistent answer to the question could be developed, therefore causing an extremely high degree of legal unpredictability and non-uniformity which inevitably generate additional negative consequences, this thesis argues that it is precisely due to the lack of such answer that another possible answer should be adopted – to deprive the current debate of its object by structurally changing the mechanism currently employed for control over arbitral awards.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (964k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, such norms are still vague, and states have an opportunity to use the most restrictive measures in the domain of anti-terrorism. Moreover, some states tend to “repurpose” anti-terrorism measures to suppress dissent in their societies. The purpose of this thesis is to look into ways, how the states may misuse anti-terrorism to silence opposing voices through the comparative analysis of national legislation and practice of Turkey and Russia in light of the case-law and standards of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The main focus is on the infringement on the rights enshrined in Art. 10 and Art. 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights by anti-terrorism measures.

Out of several branches of law affected by this concept, the research will focus primarily on structuring, i.e. on the choices of corporate vehicles for business operations and legal consequences that such choices brings with them. In addition, special attention will be paid to tax considerations of such options as they by default heavily affect both the choice of business vehicles and operations of private equity industry in general. The primary reason for making such analysis lies in the fact that up to date scholarly works on legal aspects of private equity in Serbia are essentially descriptive. They do not give the answer as to why private equity industry in the country has not made a substantial progress for more than a decade after its regulation. Nor do they establish a comparative model upon which the industry can look upon. In this research, it is suggested that the US system may serve as such model. For these purposes, it explores the characteristics of the US system and the options it offers. The thesis will conclude that having a choice between several business vehicles and tax treatments is beneficial for the development of private equity industry in a country. Notably, the system needs to provide the possibility for private equity funds and firms to operate as flexible entities that are also fiscally transparent. This conclusion outlines the need for the developing countries to constantly reexamine their approach when it comes to the legal treatment of private equity.

This thesis addresses the issue of secondary liability of online service providers (OSPs) for third-party copyright infringements in the light of the recent proposal for the E.U. copyright reform. The aim of this study is to determine whether the proposed measures would serve the purpose of eliminating the causes of an unfair distribution of revenues received from the copyright-protected content, i.e. a ‘value gap’ problem. The comparative and functional analysis of the U.S. and the E.U. legal frameworks demonstrates that the former imposes more lenient obligations on OSPs and encourages their cooperation with copyright owners in combating copyright infringements, while the latter provides a possibility to impose additional duties on OSPs, which forces them to be more proactive in detecting and eliminating online copyright violations. Based on the results of this analysis and the assessment of compatibility of the draft Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market with the existing legal regime in the E.U., it is concluded that the proposed measures on clarification of a hosting ‘safe harbor’ and imposition on OSPs of an obligation to apply content recognition technologies would not be effective and efficient, since they will, inter alia, result in an imbalance between the rights of copyright holders and the rights of OSPs.

Namely, liquidations resulted in thousands of employees left jobless, assets accumulated over many years being sold off for a fraction of their former value and, for owners, a permanent loss of credibility and business reputation. Such loss of credibility and reputation ultimately stems from the impact of a so-called ‘bankruptcy stigma,’ in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it is common to equate insolvency proceedings and debt restructuring with liquidation, it is viewed as the end of for a business, rather than an opportunity for a second chance. The thesis will include some proposals on how a business culture favoring out-of-court workouts and pre-bankruptcy reorganization plans could be domesticated. With this agenda in mind, on the one hand, the focus will be on the nature, typology and identification of key legal problems corollary to out-of-court workout agreements.

In the onset of the age of genetic inventions, human genes were firstly thought to be a non-patentable subject matter however that concept was abolished. As the technology further advances it give birth to express sequence tags or ESTs. They are small sequences of cDNA and extracted with a gene sequencing machine. EST is primarily used as a shortcut in pinpoint only the expressing genes, which are the genes that carry information for the protein synthesis. Unfortunately EST can only locate the expressed gene but it cannot provide any further information about it, in other terms it can locate something for what there is yet no information about its characteristic or function. Subsequently after the NIH’s EST patent application is filled it gave rise to a fear that EST will create a patent ticket. General opinion that ESTs patents can get exclusive right over the sequence for which they tag. EST producing companies would have an exclusive right to exclude others from commercially exploit them. This complex situation sparked the desire to further research the probability of ESTs satisfying patentability requirements in the two most biotechnology advanced continents Europe and United States. The methodology would be comparative where ESTs would be compared to patentability requirements prescribed by patent law both of Europe and United States. Previous research conducted by the Trilateral office will be used as the starting point on with an attempt to agree with their findings.

Due process (the right to liberty and security of a person) and fair trial rights of individuals suspected or accused of terrorism are particularly targeted by such measures. During the fight against terrorism, international judicial human rights bodies have been trying to balance these fundamental values against the national security interest. However, in doing so, they rely on a traditional approach of giving states a certain level of discretion when dealing with emergencies. The aim of this paper is to assess the level of deference given to States in cases of derogation from the right to a fair trial and due process and suggest that international judicial and quasi-judicial bodies should develop and apply a stricter scrutiny when examine alleged violations. It will argue that, if such a scrutiny is clearly established, ex officio application of the derogation clause by human rights bodies might be beneficial for upholding the principles of criminal justice, which are often altered by counter-terrorism legislation. Comparative analysis will be provided based on three multilateral human rights treaties - the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the American Convention on Human Rights.

Strangely, the President suggested France, a famously unitary state, as a model for federalism in the Philippines. This paper will discuss the Philippine’s embattled relationship with federalism and examine the different models of federalism in various jurisdictions. France will also be examined to see if it is appropriate for the context of decentralization in the Philippines, but the focus will be mainly on Malaysia and Nepal’s background and history with federalism, in order to learn from their experiences.

More specifically, through comparative method, it examines grounds for, and possible benefits of application of the doctrine, in Serbian legal system. Under US law, corporate criminal liability is based on the respondeat superior doctrine, meaning that it will be liable for criminal actions of its employees and agents, undertaken for benefits of corporation and within the scope of their employment. As an exception to this general rule, the RCO doctrine justifies imposing criminal liability to the corporate officers even not personally participated in wrongful transaction or aware of the wrongdoing, simply holding them liable on the basis of their responsible position in legal entity, and power to prevent wrongdoing. On the other hand, Serbian law establishes criminal liability of legal entities exclusively on culpability of their responsible persons. This means that corporation will be held liable if, on one hand, responsible person actively participates in criminal activity or, on another, omits to exercise due supervision over his subordinates. Having in mind open grounds for abuses, and unjustified consequences of impossibility to hold corporation liable if omission of supervision has not been proved, but actions were still committed for the benefit of corporation, this thesis aims to show that in order to prevent all negative consequences that this scenario could cause, introducing of strict criminal liability for corporate officer under RCO doctrine, would be â€“ an appropriate solution.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (970k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Thus, every government needs to rely upon SMEs in order to boost growth in their economies. The validity of the SMEs’ economic contribution is not the exclusivity of the US, Europe and other advanced economies. Rather, their significance is much more apparent for the developing countries, where SMEs could be the key to rebuild the economy. Especially, in Syria where the present war has already driven the country to economic despair, it is crucial to understand that the support of SMEs, as well as the application of appropriate funding mechanisms, could be the means to reform the broken economic systems and relieve the markets after the war. In light of these considerations, this paper will focus on the three potential forms of SME financing in Syria as a crucial step of the revival of its economy. The first form includes various government-sponsored special projects that include financial support as well. The second possible source of financing is exploitation of asset-based financing, where the two most readily available financing forms are: title finance (focusing on leasing) and receivable. The third possible source of financing is provided by private equity firms.

In civil law countries like Germany and Uzbekistan rules that regulate situations when a parent company can be held liable for the actions of its subsidiary are of statutory nature and are contained in Codes and Acts. This thesis analyzes “enterprise liability” rules in each of these jurisdictions and provides their comparison. These approaches to parent-subsidiary liability differ with their sources, the scope of application, however, they all are aimed at providing protection to the subsidiary’s creditors and other shareholders.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (799k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

I use examples from four jurisdictions to explore how judicial review may deal with questionable features of electoral systems. The research methodology largely relies on black letter law research. It includes the ECtHR jurisprudence as well as comparative study of constitutional court judgments of four chosen jurisdictions: Armenia, the Czech Republic, Italy, and Turkey. Special attention is paid to the Venice Commission’s opinions and other sources of Council of Europe’s soft law that have to do with electoral rights and electoral standards. Recognizing the institutional differences of the ECtHR, constitutional courts and the Venice Commission, the comparative analysis demonstrates that the ECtHR’s interpretation of the right to free elections has not yet extended the protection of electoral rights beyond participation in elections, to the distribution of mandates and resulting composition of the legislature.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (537k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

When selecting arbitration, parties take into consideration several of its advantages; some of which are confidentiality, analysis of the issue at hand by arbitrators who are experts in certain fields and finality of an award. By selecting arbitration, parties exclude the stateâ€™s intervention in the settlement of their dispute. It can be argued that the two most important inherent features of arbitration are finality and party autonomy. That said, courts of different jurisdiction might find it upon themselves to interfere in this dispute settlement mechanism, one way or another. States put in place a review and/or appeal mechanism for different policy considerations. However, it can be agreed that the review of courts on arbitration awards should be limited and proportional to the benefit the state is seeking to achieve. It should not, in any way, frustrate the foremost benefit of arbitration, i.e. effective settlement of disputes.

Today, nearly 2 billion people are active users of online markets. E-commerce, in its unique way, is the only borderless market and this feature makes its regulation highly complicated as of today, states are not able to agree on uniform set of rules that will govern the immense online market. The international nature of E-commerce constantly raises legal questions as the law struggles to catch up to a changing world. The non-geographical nature of E-commerce makes the traditional application of choice of law and jurisdiction rules difficult to apply, as these were designed for a pre internet age, based on connection factors, the strongest being geographical in nature. In E-commerce, it is highly complicated for the parties to identify the real location of the other as the transaction is based on informal declarations that are not all the time accurate, and even these geographical indicators can fail while talking about the contracts performed online. In order to ensure predictability and certainty in E-commerce transaction instead of using connecting geographical indicators it would be more useful to identify proper law and jurisdiction based on party autonomy. However even in this hypothesis it is highly probable that improper law and jurisdiction will be applicable. Such risk emerges because of unequal bargain power of the parties, E-businesses are usually assisted by professional lawyers that are able to design the terms of an E-contract in the favor of their clients. At the same time consumers are less likely to be aware about the meaning and consequences of such clauses as choice of law and choice of jurisdiction, furthermore they are not even able to negotiate the terms before agreeing to them. Hence validity and enforceability of these clauses are of a primary importance, especially because of the fast growing online market. This thesis will outline the main features of E-commerce contracts with specific references on choice of law and jurisdiction clauses. Also thesis will provide an overview of choice of law and jurisdiction laws in the EU, US, and Chinese legal system.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (997k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

In the recent years, this trend of obliging Internet Intermediaries to monitor all the content they host in order to expeditiously delete illegal one, has started spreading especially among European countries. The thesis analyzes the strict liability regime imposed to Internet Intermediaries for third-party content in the cases of online hate speech, by presenting solutions adopted recently by ECtHR and Germany. At the same time, it makes parallel to the Indian solution, where broad immunity regime was introduced, making Internet Intermediaries liable only in case they fail to obey a court order. Seeking to provide an answer to the question whether imposing strict liability to Internet Intermediaries is a proper way of combating online hate speech, the thesisâ€™ major finding concludes that Internet Intermediaries, as private actors, should not be imposed with such type of liability, especially not in the cases of online hate speech. This regime undermines freedom of expression and introduces high level of censorship, since Internet Intermediaries, as private actors lacking legal knowledge and afraid of being punished, often err and delete content out of caution, especially when deciding about alleged hate speech content. At the same time, strict liability regime represents an excessive burden for Internet Intermediaries, since it requires additional resources and enormous personnel in order to pre-screen entire third-party content. Additionally, it endangers third-parties due process rights and privacy rights. By explaining all the negative implications of strict liability regime through comparative analysis of different legal solutions, the thesis in a systematic manner calls upon the states to refrain themselves from imposing this type of liability to Internet Intermediaries.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1027k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Despite unsafe abortion being a public health concern, abortion is rarely discussed as a matter of reproductive health endangering women’s health and lives. While reproductive autonomy remains the pillar of women’s access to safe abortion, alone it is insufficient to guarantee legal and effective abortion in societies which have a history of institutionalized gender discrimination and where abortion is a complex social construct. The thesis argues how right to reproductive health can be a legal ground for ensuring effective access to safe abortion, since it imposes positive obligations on states to fulfill elements and conditions of reproductive health care in domestic systems. The thesis analyzes how women’s rights are affected by the dynamics of lawmaking and prevalence of socio-cultural factors over scientific achievements in reproductive medicine. Relying on the feminist critique of liberal theory of human rights, the thesis addresses the shortcomings of the theory in the context of access to safe abortion as part of the right to reproductive health in states with historically strong opposition to reproductive rights.

These rights for women originate from the concept of ‘bodily autonomy’, which has many times been derived from the rights to ‘life’, ‘liberty’, and ‘dignity’ by Courts. The essence of these fundamental rights remains quite pertinent for the women of South and South East Asia, as often, the existence of such rights for women is questionable. States with restrictive abortion legislation do not only curb women’s right to their ‘bodily autonomy’ but also their right to make a choice. In Pakistan, India and Malaysia, abortion is criminalized, apart from certain exceptions with regards to saving the life the health of the woman. Women requiring abortion services are left at the disposal of the Courts, social and cultural stigma, and third party authorizations, or have to resort to illegal and unsafe abortions. The challenges are more amplified for survivors of rape who require abortions, in each country. Along with the psychological trauma that comes with sexual assault, women have to navigate through a system which only makes it more problematic for them to exercise control over their bodies.

In order for the protection orders effectively to fulfil their mission, states, officials of law enforcement authorities and even ordinary citizens must realize the deep-rooted nature of violence against women.

It addresses the issues arising in the legal protection of IDPs from international, regional and national perspectives and questions what a solution can be. Firstly, it evaluates whether the existing international humanitarian and human rights law provide sufficient protection to IDPs during all stages of displacement. It concludes that even though the relationship of these two bodies of law is complementary, there are gaps in the legal protection of IDPs to be fulfilled. At the same time, the thesis highlights the absence of international binding instrument and demonstrates why the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement currently represent the most comprehensive framework. Secondly, this thesis examines the practices of national legislators and their success in bringing legislation in line with international standards. By analyzing and comparing the national legal frameworks of Colombia and Ukraine, it recognizes that domestic legislators fail to address the specific protection needs of IDPs. Thus, even though the Guiding Principles is a very important standard-setting document, being a soft law, it does not impose any obligations on states, while national legislators are reluctant to incorporate them. Moreover, the thesis questions how the African Union Kampala Convention for the Protection and Assistance of IDPs in Africa, as the first regional binding treaty on internal displacement, has advanced the legal protection of IDPs. The research discovers that its framework more encompassing and sensitive to the specific human rights concerns in the context of displacement if compared to the national legislation of Ukraine and Colombia. Thus, the thesis draws three major lessons from the practices of Ukraine, Colombia and the African Union. By relying on these lessons and considering both arguments for and against, it claims that a treaty on internal displacement is a possible solution to the challenge of internal displacement.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1342k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Linguistic rights are a subset of minority rights and they are present throughout human rights documents and instruments but only in a small manner. They are not directly given to only minorities in the European Convention on Human Rights for example but are given a mention or interpreted in the right to fair trial or the right to education. An effort will be made to examine the right to be educated in one’s mother tongue which technically does not exist under the European Convention but is nonetheless present in some shape or form. This very narrow reading and perspective of linguistic rights and minority rights is seen through the lens of educational rights because linguistic rights as such do not exist under that name. The system put in place during the years is designed to favor a progressive realization through the United Nations and Council of Europe documents. Together with national legislation and Constitutional protection linguistic rights of minorities should technically be protected. Historical perspectives are analyzed because of their importance in providing context to the comparators’ behavior and stance towards the minorities. Minorities in these three countries have been living for centuries and have been a part of the culture, history and development even though their mother tongue is different. As minorities they have faced discrimination and were victims of damaging policies, especially in the area of language and linguistic rights. Even though the three comparators have moved away from subjugating minorities and trying to assimilate them, their current efforts to secure minority rights that are guaranteed by the States themselves is not enough. The exact actions of the comparators are to grant minorities linguistic rights in education, but they are not completely followed through and the minorities are facing obstacles. These actions and barriers consist of territorial application of minority rights, only providing for non-compulsory language education or outright denial of school registration. Without a strong system of supervision and without support from the European Court of Human Rights, the reluctance of the comparators to follow through their obligations creates a weak system of protection for these minorities.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (980k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Human Rights Program master theses ; 2018/4', 'Language': 'English', 'Summary': 'The Ahmadiyya community is a marginalized religious minority group in Pakistan. Although it identifies itself as a Muslim movement that follows the teachings in the Quran, it is regarded as heretical by the mainstream (Sunni) Muslims in Pakistan. The laws of the country have been designed to further marginalize the Ahmadis. The Second Amendment to the constitution of Pakistan officially declares Ahmadis as non-Muslims. Furthermore, in 1984, under the Zia ordinance, Ahmadis are not allowed to call themselves Muslims or to ""pose as Muslims."" Today, the community primarily lives in a small town of 70,000 people, called Rabwah, which serves as the headquarters of the community. The Ahmadiyya community is not involved in the political process of the country and individual Ahmadis continue to be jailed for ‘posing as Muslims.’ For this study, I carried out an extensive field research for a month in Rabwah. The respondents were both community members and government officials. I collected data on how citizenship rights such as freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and freedom to profess religion are violated. The paper discusses how Pakistan violates international human rights standards of citizenship with regard to its treatment of Ahmadis. However, the main argument of this thesis is to demonstrate that even in situations where a dominant religion persecutes a religious minority, the minority group can still survive if it has a strong value system. Therefore, a substantial part of the paper will give a detailed explanation of the administrative system of the Ahmadi community and the institutions that are created parallel to the government systems. I will also show how a religious minority like the Ahmadiyya community coexists as a persecuted minority within a country that mostly has a homogenous dominant religion (Sunni). Finally, the paper argues that the Ahmadiyya community has developed a very organized and bureaucratic administrative system as a strategy for preserving and maintaining its identity and values.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1230k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Human Rights Program master theses ; 2018/1', 'Language': 'English', 'Summary': ""This thesis addresses the implications that the secondary movements of Palestinian refugees have on their right of return. Particularly, it examines whether these secondary movements to outside UNRWA mandate area have created a dual right of return for Palestinian refugees: the original right of return to their homes in historic Palestine and another right of return to countries of first asylum where UNRWA operates. Palestinian refugees are considered among the most vulnerable categories of refugees due to their complex status under international law. As they do not fall under the scope of the international refugee system, they have their own regime under the umbrella of UNRWA, which operates in five main entities (Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza). There are great disparities between these entities when it comes to the overall national policy towards Palestinian refugees, with Lebanon being the harshest in terms of treating its Palestinian population. The vulnerability of Palestinians in their first host states has been the main motivation towards considering applying to asylum elsewhere. It has created a flow of secondary movements to outside UNRWA mandate area in order to seek protection and dignified living conditions. These movements to outside UNRWA mandate area have added complexity to the originally proclaimed right of return. This thesis firstly explains the morality and legality of Palestinians’ right of return to historic Palestine. It then addresses the reality that Palestinian refugees endure within UNRWA mandate area, and highlights the patterns of their secondary movements to outside UNRWA operations’ area, particularly to EU member states. After explaining the development of the official EU approach towards Palestinian asylum seekers and the characteristics of Palestinians' secondary movements to EU, this thesis concludes that the secondary movements of Palestinian refugees to outside UNRWA mandate area have created a dual right of return. Additionally, these continuous movements expose the protection gap that Palestinian refugees have been vulnerable of for decades."", 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2342k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The CRPD elaborates upon disability-specific hardships on the exercise of rights already protected by former human rights instruments. Following Article 26 of the UDHR, Article 24 of the CRPD explicitly brings persons with profound and multiple disabilities (PMD) within the scope of the right to inclusive education. There is some clarity today on how the CRPD Committee envisages inclusive education systems (General Comment No. 4). Yet, for many governments such vision cannot be more than a flagship command. Is the standard of Article 24 unrealistically high then? The central puzzle of my paper revolves around the tension of including children with PMD in the mainstream education system. Their right to inclusive education is understood in the context of domestic legal standards and their marginalized social status within the education system. The point of departure for comparing domestic legal frameworks of Ireland, Hungary and South Africa is the CRPD Committee’s understanding of inclusive education. The comparative analysis is conducted for two purposes: Firstly, taking account of the historical context current legislation and case law are analyzed to identify the aptitude of domestic legal systems with regards to the educational rights of children with PMD. Secondly, in light of the comparative analysis it is presented how the ambitious standard of Article 24 can be implemented for children with high support needs on the ground.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1486k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Traditionally core rights and liberties, such as the right to life, freedom of speech, freedom from slavery, just to mention a few, are now looked from a Human Rights approach. The guidelines to understand these rights are now found in the international treaties and conventions on Human Rights, in both global and regional levels. The signing States parties of such conventions and treaties have undertaken the commitment to adopt and implement the principles crystalized in these binding instruments. This commitment includes legislative, administrative, and judiciary efforts to achieve the outlined system of rights. Ideally, the Legislature branch would reform the Constitution and enact laws; the Executive branch would implement public policies accordingly; and the Judiciary would interpret the other two powers’ acts in the light of the treaties and conventions conforming the Human Rights system. This research will study the Inter-American context, at both regional as well as a domestic levels, taking as examples of the latter Mexico and Colombia. The object of this thesis is to analyze the role of the Courts, as they shape the rights covered by the InterAmerican Convention on Human Rights. The aim is to pinpoint the cases where the aforementioned Courts’ interpretations have gone beyond the text of the international instruments on Human Rights, and have ended up creating rights not covered (at least by the letter) in the signed treaties nor in the addendums. In some cases, even getting to the extent of locating these “newly found” rights at Human Rights level of protection.

Feminist, legalists and international relations scholars have focused their discussions on whether rape shall include the consent element or coercion, whether rape shall be framed as “weapon of war” or only as rape-in-peace, and how “weapon of war” frame may be improved. These debates have arisen from the inconsistent jurisprudence of the ad hoc tribunals which were the first ever courts prosecuting wartime sexual violence. Therefore, as a first step, the thesis explores case-law rendered by the international courts followed by various scholarly discussions. The “weapon of war” framed as a security issue has proven to be very successful when prosecuting conflict-related rape. However, any framework for redressing complex problems is bound to be limiting. The thesis identifies “weapon of war” frame as being selective, unfair and politically oriented. The aim of the thesis is to not to be damning, but instead to assess the frame and to identify challenges when frame has been put on trial. The thesis will offer a contribution to considered reflections of rape as a “weapon of war”. Prosecutor’s offices develop the scope of crimes already in the indictment, which means that they have major role in framing “weapon of war” on trial. In that sense, the thesis is written from prosecutor’s office lenses when applying theory to the facts. The research focuses on critically exploring already available evidence on the wartime rape in Syria and on applying these facts to the challenges identified within the case-law of two jurisdictions. The aim of the thesis is to provide policy recommendation for the Syrian Public Prosecutors Office in order to tackle with the selective framing of rape as a “weapon of war”.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1233k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

It begins by exposing the myth that same-sex sexual behaviors were non-existent in pre-colonial sub-Africa. Following this, it moves into the colonial-era regulation of sexuality in sub-Saharan Africa and reveals the racialized basis for the first iterations of the “un-Africanness” of same-sex sexual behavior. This first iteration was based on the idea that same-sex sexual behavior was a result of the descendance of more “advanced” cultures. Black Africans did not exhibit this behavior because they were perceived to be more “primitive” and “closer to nature”. This background informs the rest of the thesis which examines the modern “un-African” framing as a post-colonial nation building project which defines the idealized sub-Saharan African citizen as sexually productive and homophobic. The deviance of those who practice or are perceived to practice “un-African” same-sex sexual behavior from this idealized citizen allows homophobic leaders in sub-Saharan Africa to depict them as allied with Western forces. This justifies the exemption of these individuals from having human rights as their citizenship and sometimes personhood is removed. This is accomplished in less formally as states in sub-Saharan Africa deny the protection of these individuals which leads to a culture of impunity and more formally as states enact laws and courts uphold and laws persecuting those who practice or are perceived to practice same-sex sexual behavior. The degree to which the human rights of these individuals are limited is specifically examined in Uganda and Kenya. This is followed by a critique of current Western advocacy strategies attempting to address these issues which often try to directly copy strategies that have worked in Western counties without accounting for differences in political circumstances. This often results in strategies that are easily portrayed by nationalist, populist, homophobic leaders in sub-Saharan Africa as Western imperialism. The final section demonstrates the global nature of the struggle for sexual rights which is in constant interaction with national politics. The purpose of this thesis is to expose the complexity of the struggle for sexual rights in sub-Saharan Africa to better inform advocacy strategies.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (762k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, a strong resistance to the compliance with its judgments and orders is taking place in the Americas. This work analyzes how two specific national courts (the Constitutional Tribunal of the Dominican Republic and the Supreme Court of Argentina) directly threatened the authority of the Inter-American Court through their decisions. This work engages with the theoretical conceptualizations (legal formalistic, normative, sociological and compliance-based approaches) that seek to explain how international courts acquire, exercise and enhance authority and legitimacy. The thesis adopts the “de facto authority model” proposed by Alter, Helfer and Madsen to explain how the Inter-American Court’s authority fluctuates according to the context of the cases and the audience it addresses. The work also explains the concept of “transnational judicial dialogue” and how it became more complex and challenging in the era of the “judicialization of international relations”. Following Huneeus’ pioneering work, this thesis reflects on the difficulties that transnational judicial dialogues face in Latin America where judges, prosecutors and judicial operators are the main actors resisting the rulings of the Inter-American Court. The type of interactions through orders of compliance and public hearings that the Inter-American Court initiated with the Constitutional Tribunal of the Dominican Republic after the ruling of the cases “Yean & Bosico” and “Expelled Dominicans and Haitians v. Dominican Republic”, and the dialogue that began after the Supreme Court of Argentina decided the Fontevecchia case are analyzed in detailed.

In light of increasing attempts by states to restrict the use of cryptographic technologies, the author will focus on two unique case-studies â€“ Russia and Turkey. In Turkey, following the attempted coup in July 2016, the authorities used the state of emergency to target activists, journalists and human rights defenders, specifically within the context of using encrypted communication tools. In Russia, several controversial amendments to the existing counter-terrorism laws were passed over the recent years that directly target encryption. As such, the two countries represent distinct examples of how governments rely on domestic anti-terrorism legislation and invoke national security to constrict online spaces, particularly the use of encryption technologies. Starting with setting out conceptional and theoretical frameworks for privacy and freedom of expression, the author will analyze scholarly works that shaped both concepts. The author will further focus on the comparative analysis of the laws that govern the use of encryption in Turkey and Russia, arguing that by invoking the notions of national security, non-democratic states bypass their obligations under international human rights law in order to restrict the use of encryption among human rights actors and members of the civil society. The author will then discuss the common themes emerging from evaluation of the situations in Russia and Turkey and will make several concrete recommendations which could help address challenges posed to the use of encryption by non-democratic states. Finally, based on the argument that encryption is intimately interconnected with the rights to privacy and freedom of expression, as evident from the two case-studies, the author will argue that due to its enabling and protective function, encryption requires special protection under international human rights law.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (784k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

But when people cannot afford their basic needs of food, housing and healthcare, all other rights and freedoms can be compromised. Social and economic rights guarantee that everyone should live in conditions that cover all these basic needs. My main claim in this thesis is that the implementation of social and economic rights had been taken away from courts’ supervision for many years, for many reasons. Meanwhile, there are examples of some jurisdictions that opened the door for the judiciary to monitor and involve in the enforcement process of social and economic rights. For instance, the South African and Colombian models proved that there is a place for an effective role for the judiciary in the development of social welfare in a country. Therefore, studying the theoretical framework of the enforcement of socio-economic rights and analyzing the case-law of these two jurisdictions, in addition to observing the development of the Egyptian constitutional system regarding social and economic rights, were essential elements for this study. The first chapter of this thesis is composed of three sections. The first section observes the specific nature of the obligations that arising from socio-economic rights and the nature of these rights. The second section shows the classic concerns against the judicial enforcement of socio-economic rights, such as the argument of separation of powers and court’s competence and legitimacy to examine these matters. The third section illustrates the legal standing conditions before courts for a constitutional adjudication, within the compared jurisdictions. The second chapter presents the constitutional framework of social and economic rights in Egypt, South Africa, and Colombia. It shows the specific features of each constitution and the formulation of socio-economic provisions. Also, it analyses the role of constitutional courts in the three countries regarding the interpretation of socio-economic rights. 6 The third chapter of this dissertation studies housing adjudication as a case study for judicial enforcement of socio-economic rights. The first section addresses the background of housing problems and forced eviction operations in the three countries. The second section illustrates how the three constitutions grants the right to housing, and the states’ obligations to realize it. The third section presents an analysis of court’s conduct toward housing problems. The fourth section shows the competing interests between the right to housing from a side and property rights and states’ development plans from the other side and the reflection of these concerns in the comparative jurisprudence. The fifth section focuses on housing adjudication in Colombia. The fourth chapter presents an analysis of three different approaches that had been adopted within the compared jurisdictions. In addition, shows the methods and challenges of each approach and its impact on the development of socio-economic rights adjudication.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1318k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This problem is easily identifiable in the process of autonomous elections of municipality government, in some communities’ women have no right to participate in the process of election, to vote or been voted. And most of the legal systems in Latin-American do not provided from guarantees for the effective access of indigenous women to political participation. Even though some States had implemented some measures to address this problem, as the imposition of gender quotas, it seems to be ineffective. The solution given by the States to control the “rules of the game” in political participation of indigenous woman can be seen as an imposition that brakes with the harmony of collective right to self-government and self-determination. Indigenous women’ right to political participation have two different aspects, in one hand is an individual right to politically participate in the decision-making process of government without discrimination, but also have a collective right as members of an indigenous community to self- determination and non-external interference.

Freemuse, an international NGO primarily reporting on attacks on artists around the globe stated that there have been 1,028 attacks and violations of artists’ rights in 2016 and this number only increased compared to the previous year. These challenges exist regardless of international and regional mechanisms of protection. The purpose of the research study is to analyse the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and its former Commission and find out whether or not the Court is delivering consistent judgements and reasoning when it comes to the protection of artistic expression in the European legal space. The methods used in this research were case-law analysis, analysis of relevant international treaties and instruments, analysis of reports by international and non-governmental organizations, theoretical assessment on the protection of speech and research on artistic expression by other scholars. After collecting all the data, case law, historical overview and legal framework, it was possible to divide the Court’s case law into five categories. The first category is the most massive and least consistent when it comes to reasoning - the category involves clashes between freedom of artistic expression and religious sensitivities. The second category involved satire as a more consistent defence used in freedom of artistic cases; however, the satirical nature of an expression even though explicitly protected by the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, is not always considered in the reasoning of the Court. Perhaps the second largest chunk of cases that occurs in regards with artistic freedom is when such freedom allegedly violates someone’s reputation which makes up the third category. Protection of reputation very often prevails over artistic expression in the Court’s decisions due to the discretion allowed for the protection of a legitimate aim in question. When the form of expression is in a form of some conduct, the Court explicitly states that such form of expression falls within the meaning of Article 10. The cases in this fourth category are quite consistent - the preference is given to the applicants - but at the same time, the sample size is quite small so far. The Court recognises that certain artistic forms, especially literary forms of art such as poetry and novels, have limited potential to impact large masses of people which in most cases in the fifth category, if spoken about, is used as the major factor to decide in favour of the applicants. By collecting and analysing case-law of the Court, as the main method, it was possible to infer that the Court should revise its case-law in order to increase consistency in reasoning to ensure better protection of the rights and higher effectiveness of the European Convention overall. Even though the consistency in judgment is problematic, a tendency towards more consistent judgments in the latest cases is visible. The research ends with a number of recommendations in the area of artistic expression protection for the members states, international, non-governmental and other relevant organisations and actors.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (626k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The Council of Constitutional inquiry (CCI), which is predominantly composed of legal experts, offer professional assistance to the HoF while interpreting the Constitution. The number of cases flowing to the CCI/HoF has increased over time. Until June 2018, a total of 3350 constitutional petitions has been filed to the CCI/HoF. Despite the raise on the flows of cases, resistance to implement the rulings of the House has, however, lately become an emerging problem. In relation to this, this paper is interested in finding out the mechanism of implementation of constitutional review decisions in Ethiopia. It is specifically interested to find out how and who executes such decision and whether the House has a role in this regard. In answering these questions, the paper has employed a comparative research methodology. The paper has consulted the experience of two countries which have strong Constitutional Court and constitutional review system: Germany and Benin, in order to see if they have better system and experience in relation to the implementation of constitutional review decisions. Accordingly, the finding suggests that in Ethiopia, both the Constitution and other relevant laws lacks provisions regulating the modalities of enforcement of decision of the House. A coercive system of enforcement which would force the recipient to comply or implement the decision of the House is also absent. Even though the House has powers to resolve constitutional disputes arising from all acts of the state, the type and nature of decision the House offers is very limited. The House does not issue directions, guidelines or remedies in its decision. As a result, the House has a limited role in controlling the fate of the execution of its decision. The experience of Germany and Benin also suggest that implementation challenge with regard to constitutional review decisions is not peculiar to Ethiopia. The execution of constitutional review decision has been resisted by state bodies at a serval occasion in both countries. While, in both countries, a full-fledged mechanism of enforcement for constitutional review decisions is absent, in Germany- the Constitutional Court Act -provides some relevant provisions in this regard. Besides, the German Constitutional Court has been progressive in expanding its influence and control over the execution of its decision. In Benin, mechanism of enforcement is also unstated both in the Constitution and the Organic Law of the Constitutional Court. The Court, on the other hand, has had a self-restrained position to progressively expand its role in the enforcements of its decision. However, later it changed its viewpoint and started issuing a more engaging and commanding decision that further its influence and control in the enforcement of its decision. The experience of the two countries suggest that the House need to adopt a progressive approach in expanding its influence over the execution of its decision pending the enactment of a law that regulates the mechanism of implementation. Sooner or later, it is important that Ethiopia enacts a law that regulates modalities of execution of constitutional review decision.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (555k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Franchise is widely recognized as a modern, yet new and complex model of doing business, making it an exceptionally interesting topic to analyze. The selection of jurisdictions is made with respect to the rich experience on franchise that comes from United States, the birthplace of business format franchise, that had been followed by Europe. Notably, business format franchise is treated differently in these two continents and that is why an analytical comparison sheds the light over the reasons for regulating, as well positive and negative features of various regulatory regimes. Serbia, on the other hand, is the central subject of this thesis. Franchise in Serbia is treated as an innominate contract, with no particular regulation and developed practice. However, the novelty in Serbia is the Draft of Civil Code that is not yet enacted, but regulates franchise for the first time. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to analyze the Draft and evaluate it by comparison with other regulatory systems.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (755k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

On the contrary, it seeks to defend the claim that the citizenship rules of a state are born out of continuous negotiations between the institutions of the state and the people residing therein.

Thereafter, it utilises these characteristics to provide a conceptual framework while describing the history of the concept in the Subcontinent.

It is a challenge to the Courts to enforce an arbitral award which is passed outside the country in a different jurisdiction or the seat outside India but following the New York Convention. The purpose of consideration of The Convention is that India is one of the signatories in the said Convention. When the proceedings of arbitration are based on the laws comprised by The Convention and thus chosen as substantive law of the proceedings, then the award which is passed by the arbitration proceedings shall be binding on both the parties. So the consideration of the arbitral awards in the Indian Courts is quite a challenge as to enforce it on the parties. The thesis mainly observes on the consideration of the award by discussing three cases from the date of passing of The Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961 or the ratification of The New York Convention till 2018. There is a detailed comparative study on the cases and the consideration of the foreign award in the Indian Courts and executing the same upon the parties who are liable.

In the Philippines, however, a single-person corporation is a novel concept that has just been introduced into its Revised Corporation Code in 2019. Proceeding from this milieu, this paper addresses the question of when the veil of single person corporations may be pierced by the courts as established by legal doctrines that have evolved through the years. Because a single person corporation enjoys limited liability as with any other corporation with multiple shareholders, it is important to study and assess the situations when the courts in the United States and the United Kingdom pierced the veil and made the sole shareholder personally liable or otherwise when the corporate veil was upheld. This study found that the corporation laws of the United States have less provisions governing single person corporations, however, their courts are more receptive in piercing the veil of single person corporations that their English counterparts. This is shown by the number of tests that American courts can apply under the veil piercing doctrine as compared to a general prohibition under English law that the corporate entity should not be used to defraud others. As for the Philippines, it has crafted safeguards in the law to ensure that one person corporations will not be used as a tool for fraud.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (388k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The specific feature of these courts is that individuals can not only submit constitutional complaint against state actions, but also initiate abstract review of constitutionality of legislative acts. This “open access’’ to the Constitutional court was a concept established in order to establish the rule of law in post–communist countries and enhance citizens’ participation in democratic processes. Nevertheless, is it really an efficient mechanism in practice? The jurisprudence of these courts has appeared to be progressive in cases regarding the protection of human rights, but not so much when it comes to solving matters which have strong impact on country’s politics or public policies. In those cases, the courts either avoid deciding the issue by denying jurisdiction or they take up strategic approach in regard to the timing of delivering the decision. In this paper I will try to prove that open access in and of itself doesn’t contribute significantly to the democratization process if the Constitutional court has a strategic or deferential approach.

It should be noted that such Rules primarily applies to technology transfer arrangements but does not specifically mention franchise agreements. It also assesses the implications of imposing regulatory prohibitions on some clauses in a franchise contract which, on its face, may seem “anti-competitive” but are in fact, actually characteristics of franchise asymmetry, an essential element in franchise arrangements in most jurisdictions. Essentially, the thesis seeks to prove that, in order to develop a more robust and enticing franchise environment in the Philippines, a careful balance must be struck between the rights of the franchisor to its know-how and intellectual property, on one hand, and the rights of the franchisee to be protected economic-wise and make an informed business decision, on the other. To achieve this objective, laws, regulations and cases in other jurisdictions with thriving economies and franchise industries such as the United States, France and Germany are analyzed and summarized in this thesis. The said countries are selected to highlight the contrasts in their systems of franchise regulations and the differences in the manner by which they respond to different stakeholders in the industry, such as the franchise associations, innovators and the consumers in general. General EU policies on competition are also assessed in this thesis as they may give insight on how to effectively implement anti-competitive policies, without compromising the need to encourage and infuse more innovations and know-how into the local economy. By assessing the pros and cons of the aforementioned foreign systems, one can learn lessons and explore possible policy options on how to further improve the Philippine franchising laws and regulations.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1936k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Aside from the insufficiency of resources, SMEs are considered not to be in a position to exert significant economic influence compared to large businesses. With this, the mandatory transparency laws are worth revisiting in order to maximize and realize its full potential through inclusivity by also extending its reach to SMEs.

This, in particular, includes taking of security interest over some or all of the project assets, especially on receivables to be generated by the completed project to secure financing. The security, however, may play more roles besides being a precondition for getting financing. From this perspective, English law’s floating charge is particularly suitable for this context because through it the creditors may encumber all present and future assets (including receivables) of the project company and does not require registration of security against each specific asset. More importantly, the floating charge may additionally give the lenders the right to appoint a receiver upon crystallization and through that take over the entire project if deadlock arises. Such step-in right of creditors is often crucial for the completion of projects. Nepal has adopted separate law on secured transaction law, among others, to regulate and address the concerns of lenders in project finance. The law is, however, silent on floating charges, the possibility of the appointment of receivers and on the concomitant step in rights. In light of this deficiency of Nepalese law, this thesis will examine the concept of floating charge and receivership offered by English law specifically in the context of project finance. The thesis will try to show and pave the way for further research that the English experiences with the floating charge and receivership can become an important method to ensure successful completion and running of various projects in financed via project finance in Nepal.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (501k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

It appears that while researchers strongly support international and sui generis transnational rules of preclusion, arbitral tribunals do not have a universally accepted approach and more often rely on the rules of preclusion of national legislation, more specifically, of the law of the arbitral seat.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (801k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

A lease has been held as one of the important financial tools by which businesses especially small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) can access capital goods since it allows them access to goods without immediate payment of cash. The focus of this thesis is regulation of the finance lease under secured transactions law. It compares the legal framework on finance lease in Uganda and the United States of America with the view to drawing lessons for Uganda from the American experience. This is done by examining the legal rules found in the relevant legal framework on finance lease in both countries with a focus on two key aspects: creation of the lease interest and its enforcement. The view taken by this thesis is that the regulatory regime on financial leasing in Uganda is currently inadequate, while the American regime on lease financing set out under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides a more comparatively robust framework. This is because the regime in Uganda is still evolving. Consequently, there are many lessons that Uganda can draw from the United Statesâ€™ experience including the application of remedies such as strict foreclosure and self-help repossession with the concomitant non breach of peace principle among others.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (863k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The purpose of this thesis is to compare the annulment of the ICSID and non-ICSID awards in terms of the procedure, scope and applicable standards of review. It is concluded that the standards developed by the domestic courts under Article 34 of the Model Law might seem more intrusive but are applied with deference to the tribunalsâ€™ findings. The standards developed in the ICSID system, on the other hand, read as rather demanding and difficult to satisfy but on many occasions have been interpreted inconsistently and unpredictably so as to justify the examination of the merits of the award.

The lack of legal tools for fast repossession of objects of leasing have proved to be one of the key problems in further development of local leasing industry in Croatia. Inadequate legal regulation of enforcement measures or lack thereof, the fact that the courts do not efficiently use available measures at their disposal to force debtors to cooperate, have led lessors to an absurd situation where they cannot protect their retained ownership through quick repossession, because often they cannot locate their own property. It is legitimate to devote this thesis to this problem because after the adoption of the first Croatian Leasing Act in 2006, albeit many scientific papers were published on leasing in Croatia, none of them focused on problems lessors face when trying to enforce their retained ownership on motor vehicles. Additionally, there are only a few papers that take critical approach towards modern enforcement regulations in Croatia which are the primary reason for problems of lessors. However, even the latter do not establish a comparative model, naming those jurisdictions whose efficient solutions Croatian legislator should follow in the future. In this research, it is suggested that the solutions employed in the United States and Germany may be exploited by Croatia to increase the efficiency of the enforcement system. Through this comparative analysis, the author aims to single out the key advantages and disadvantages of the analyzed systems, as well as to exemplify with case law the practical side of leasing and crucial problems of lessors with enforcement on vehicles in Croatia.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (830k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Under different jurisdictions, this social, economic and cultural right protects the most pivotal right to housing, which indirectly corresponds to other human rights. However, when it comes to the fulfillment of the right to adequate housing for vulnerable groups, this right despite it being the positive obligation of the State, is simply ignored in many instances. In this thesis, the main target group of analysis in the area of the right to housing is the Roma. This group was chosen for this thesis because of the specificity of the violation of their housing rights, which leads to the total exclusion of this community in social life. Moreover, the brutal violation of the right to housing for Roma not only by the State but also by right-wing organizations results in forced evictions. A comparative analysis of three jurisdictions was conducted for the purposes of identifying a better application of international legal instruments in this field. The international authority of the European Court of Human Rights, the European Committee of Social Rights, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination, all contribute to a discussion about the issue of recent forced evictions of Roma in Ukraine. Thus, this thesis questions how the failure of protection of the right to adequate housing for Roma brought about the forced eviction as part of racial state practice across Europe. In answering the thesis question, in the light of three domains, a violation of the right to housing for Roma was analyzed through its theoretical foundations and case law.

Terrorism is a security concern for many States and a particularly motivating factor for enhancing national security laws. Following 9/11, there was a proliferation of anti-terrorism regulation as well as policies aimed at countering violent extremism (or radicalisation) domestically, as exampled by the UK and US. Also, internationally, as is reflected by different bodies of the UN; namely the Security Council, Human Rights Council, Human Rights Committee, and Special Procedures. This thesis considers that the jurisdictional tests for protecting free expression with the broad and undefined national security aims give way to regulation which can, and do, impede free expression. In particular, examining how the lack of a universal and concise definition of those threats has led to the excessive and overbroad regulation which has, in turn, had an absurd and arbitrary chilling effect on important actors in our democracies, invoking examples of the media, journalists, human rights defenders, academics, Internet intermediaries, and vulnerable persons and groups. This thesis will identify the domestic free speech and national security justifications and standards, as well as the authoritative interpretation and scrutiny of UN bodies. Utilising this comparative assessment, the thesis will then foster a more pragmatic defining approach to such regulation.

The role of the TNCs in developing countries is important because it is the source of foreign investment. Unfortunately, TNCs’ operation in developing countries may sometimes lead to severe human rights violations. As these countries’ legal and regulatory frameworks are mostly undeveloped. There is no proper protection against such abuses and victims are not always able to access proper remedies. A major reason for this inability to access remedies is the corporate shield between parent and subsidiary corporation. This thesis argues that currently used corporate veil piercing doctrine is not efficient to make parent company indirectly liable for human rights abuses. It therefore suggests that the corporate veil piercing test ought to be relaxed in human rights violations. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the comparative analysis of corporate veil piercing in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany. A comparative analysis gives different ways of conceiving the corporate veil piercing test in these three jurisdictions. The second part examines the suitability of the given standards in the human rights violation cases and the necessity of balancing between shareholders’ limited liabilities and remedies for human rights victims.

Not only does these practices contribute to child marriage, but they are also very difficult to be detached from the people who practice them because that has become their way of living. Legal frameworks in both Jurisdictions protecting the rights of the child as well as policies and programs put in place to mitigate the practice will also be assessed. This study explores these challenges and proposes solutions where available', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (765k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, due to inequality in income levels and various other social, economic, and political factors, states have considered it necessary to take regulatory measures inconsistent with this obligation. Apart from regulatory regimes, States are more inclined to enter into Preferential Trade Agreements with selected trading partners. This research explores the MFN principle at the multilateral level by examining the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and at the regional level by analysing the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA). The analysis focuses on the difference between the unconditional MFN in GATS and the novel reciprocal MFN in the AfCFTA. The research undertakes a review of the literature and scholarly articles on the GATS and AfCFTA to analyse the legal implication of key distinguishing terms such as unconditionality and reciprocity. Further, it provides an overview of the foundation of the AfCFTA to determine the rationale behind the newly formulated reciprocal MFN clause. The analysis indicates that politically AfCFTA Members need to have absolute autonomy in negotiating trade preferences. The thesis further highlights practical and administrative challenges to the implementation of the AfCFTA reciprocal MFN. On this basis, it is recommended that the term reciprocal is clearly defined to minimise complexity and uncertainty in the negotiation process. As existing agreements under the Regional Economic Communities form part of the AfCFTA legal architecture, Member States must focus on the overall reduction of trade barriers as opposed to creating new preferential agreements.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (581k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This system allows foreign investors to request huge amounts of compensation for any government intervention that would have an adverse effect on their investments. In addition to it, vaguely stipulated expropriation rules in the BITs, to which Kyrgyzstan is a party, primarily favors the interests of foreign investors. Hence, this paper seeks to suggest a legal definition of indirect expropriation that strikes an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the rights of foreign investors and, on the other hand, the sovereign regulatory authority of the country. For this reason, expropriation clause under the Indian Model BIT is analyzed and compared with the expropriation clauses under the BITs, which have been used as the legal basis for claims of foreign investors against Kyrgyzstan. Further, it examines whether the use of expropriation clause under the Indian Model BIT would have precluded the disputes or positively have changed the outcomes for Kyrgyzstan should it be used instead of the expropriation clause invoked by the investors against Kyrgyzstan. It is concluded that, as such, expropriation rule under Article 5 of the Indian Model BIT does not strike a balance between the interests of host states and foreign investors. Moreover, it would not have changed positively the outcomes of investment disputes. Nevertheless, expropriation rule under the Indian Model BIT has the merit of establishing a flexible, case-specific set of factors to address the question of how to determine indirect expropriation. Moreover, it gives an opportunity to states to invoke a police power exception precluding the constitution of indirect expropriation. Hence, although, having not balanced the interests of host states and investors, the alternative expropriation rule under the Indian Model BIT would have helped Kyrgyzstan at least to invoke police power exception favoring the statesâ€™ interests.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (807k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, the barrier of access to finance impedes the growth of SMEs. The Secured Transactions in Movable Asset Act, 2017 (hereinafter: STMA) was enacted with the main objective of stimulating responsible lending to SMEs and to facilitate access to credit secured with movable assets. The passage of the STMA was a step in the right direction as it introduces the use of movable property, a new concept that includes also intangibles but not IP rights as collateral. Albeit, it does not make the priority of creditors maximally predictable both within and outside insolvency as this can gain the trust of creditors to advance loan accessible at a lower cost to SMEs. Again, its enforcement mechanism admits to the use of private receivers who are incentivized to act in the interest of the appointing secured creditor rather than the interest of the business, this is antithetical to the objective of the STMA. Yet again, the rules of perfection are unclear as they admit to the creation of charges at the Corporate Affairs Commission register (Hereinafter : CAC) enacted under the Companies and Allied Matter Act (Hereinafter : CAMA) .These complexities in the STMA stagnate the viability of financing SMEs through movable asset. Having these deficiencies in sight, this paper will focus on four critical elements for an efficient secured transactions law which are crucial for financing SMEs. These elements are vital to attain lower cost of credit to increase the amount of credit advanced by creditors. The first element addresses the scope of movable assets approved under the STMA. The second issue targeted is how to improve the perfection rules to make the system more transparent as far as priorities are concerned? The third element which this paper will buttress on are the rules of priority. The final element will reflect the enforcement mechanisms employed under the STMA. This paper will start with illustrating the importance of secured transactions law in financing SMEs with reference to the objective and terminology provided under UNCITRAL Model and Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 (hereinafter: UCC Art 9). The focus will be on the recently passed Nigerian STMA Act and its four key systemic defects in the light of Nigerian economic realities. The thesis will proffer recommendations that contemplate the peculiarities in the Nigerian regime. Given that the Nigerian secured transactions law reform was influenced by the UNCITRAL Model Law, which was influenced by UCC Art 9, this thesis will reference, compare and advocate for improvements in the Nigerian regime using the aforementioned laws.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (538k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

It is characterized by numerous difficult questions. Who are future generations? Do current generations have any reason to consider their interests, if these are ascertained to exist? How do we identify, and protect, those interests? The research question this project sets itself to answer is what are the characteristics of the legal concept and what are the ways in which they manifest themselves in the constitutional life of a state. The project uses a comparative constitutional law methodology to look at those examples where future generations appear, with the objective of making a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the notion in constitutional law. Due to the numerous instances of future generations provisions at the international level, the scope is limited to Member States of the Council of Europe. The analytical part of the project will show that future generations have a lot of constitutional potential, since there is an important number of mentions of responsibility towards them in foundational texts, but the practice remains almost non-existent. The reason for the abyss existing between text and practice will be identified as stemming from the citizen-subject divide and the enforcer-beneficiary divide. These could be considered difficulties, but the paper defends that they should not be seen as barriers for the development of protection—they just force us to look in new places for answers. It is defended in this paper that the state has a ‘duty of care’ for future generations, a commitment that has been clearly established in constitutional texts across Europe. It is further argued that there is no need to frame this protection on human rights terms, since the characteristics of future generations as a subject of law do not fit in appropriately. The ‘duty of care’ is sufficiently well-grounded to serve as a source and mechanism of protection on its own.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (429k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, the existing jurisprudence suggests that even before the ECtHR, the prospect of success is predominantly limited to procedural aspects of public involvement and the weighing of the relevant public and private interests. As a next step, the paper analyzes a possible route towards enhancing individual rights protection in the subject domain and finds that strategic litigation could aim at requesting the ECtHR to expressly rely on the procedural standards of the Aarhus Convention as interpreted by the Aarhus Committee. The most important findings are the sporadic but relevant existence of a reliance to the principles and standards of the Aarhus Convention by the ECtHR in its existing case-law as well as the synthesis of the justification offered by the ECtHR. The paper also draws an original parallel between the adoption of external bodes of law in the domain of child protection under Article 8 and argues that the justifications of that reliance are transposable to the proposed reliance on the Aarhus standards.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (469k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, the right to mental health and mental well-being of people are often neglected by the states. Under the International Convention on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, State Parties’ responsibility to protect, ensure, and fulfill the right to mental health is not limited to its citizens, and the legal obligation should be applied for refugees and asylum-seekers as a nondiscriminatory manner. Refugees and asylum seeker’s right to mental health, and their access to adequate mental health services are crucial. Based on the definition in the 1951 Refugee Convention, a refugee is a person who must leave their country of origin because of the well-founded fear of being executed based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion. Refugees and asylum-seekers experienced war, torture, rape, and any other forms of harmful and violent events, which results in many refugees and asylum-seekers suffer from severe mental health disorders (Bogic et al., 2015; Ingleby, 2004). Within the refugee population, child refugees are a particularly vulnerable group. Existing literature demonstrates that child refugees and asylum-seekers are subjected to severe mental health issues as well (Fazel & Stein, 2002). This thesis seeks an answer to the question of how the right to the mental health of minor refugees and asylum-seekers is addressed in legislative, institutional, and civil society levels in Turkey and Greece. In the first part, the right to mental health for child asylum-seekers under international human rights is discussed by examining the relevant international human rights treaties, the United Nations General Comments, and case law. In the second part, the asylum laws, institutional structures, barriers to access to mental health services in practice are examined critically. Finally, in the third part, the role of civil society organizations and Turkey and Greece’s cooperation with nonstate actors are examined. As the research methodology for the final section, the author conducted in-depth interviews with child protection officers who work in national and international NGOs.

These mandate that electoral lists will have to consist of alternating female and male candidates, in an effort to increase the share of women in parliaments. Although parliamentary gender quotas are a growing international phenomenon, the constitutionality of the two acts is controversial and litigation is underway. This comparative analysis examines which arguments on the constitutionality of parity laws have been discussed in France and Spain, how they resemble or differ from and how they can inform the debate taking place in Germany. In France, quotas were originally found unconstitutional, but parity is now enshrined in the constitution. In Spain, however, a 40 percent “flexible parity” passed constitutional muster. Opponents of gender quotas contend that they are incompatible with a universalist notion of representation, which prescribes making any distinctions between voters or candidates. The universalist concept of representation is, however, challenged by descriptive and pluralists accounts. Gender quotas are moreover widely perceived to compromise electoral equality, but when they are gender-neutral, they do not affect formal equality between women and men. They do, however, severely limit the freedom of voters and candidates in the candidate selection process, as well as the autonomy of political parties. Some proponents of parity argue that it is a requirement of democracy properly understood, relying on an alleged fundamental division of humanity into men and women, on feminist insight into the male construction of the political sphere, or on the necessity of effective political participation of women, respectively. Like universalist representation, however, such concepts of parity democracy build less on posited constitutional law than on politico-legal theories. Other supports of gender quota rely on substantive gender equality, viewing quotas as affirmative action instrument. Such an approach leads to a proportionality analysis and the constitutionality of gender quotas depends on how disadvantages of women in the political sphere are perceived and how substantive equality in this field is weighed against electoral freedom and party autonomy. For Germany, it seems most likely that the courts will follow the predominant position in German legal scholarship and find gender quotas to be in violation of constitutional law. Like their French counterparts, parity proponents in Germany would then have to elevate their advocacy to the level of constitutional amendment, which comparative perspective shows would not be in conflict with democracy.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (731k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Despite the recent legislative developments, the regulation of franchise in Ethiopia is far from being adequate, in particular, it fails to provide a clear regulatory framework and is unable to respond to the existing franchise abuses in Ethiopia. These defects result in lots of uncertainties that will inevitably negatively affect entrepreneurship and the emergence of a viable strong local franchise industry as well as be an obstacle in attracting foreign franchisors which could contribute to the country’s economy. The aim of this thesis is to critically assess the protection of franchisees in Ethiopia as one of the cornerstones of modern business format franchise by analyzing the recent Ethiopian legislative developments aimed at promoting the business model in light of global and local trends as well as the experiences of selected jurisdictions. The comparison will extend to three countries’ laws and experiences. The United States is chosen because of its rich experience in franchise regulation as it is the origin of the business model itself. Hungary was chosen because it represents the other spectrum of the regulation with more historical similarity with Ethiopia and economic proximity in comparison with other European countries and additionally because of similarity in the regulation and protection of franchisees.

Yet, while some presidents are reasonably neutral, others disregard neutrality requirements altogether. Besides sharp differences in presidential neutrality between countries, we find variations within a country as well, where some presidents are visibly more neutral than others. This thesis aims to explore what explains these differences in the political neutrality of presidents across and within countries. More specifically, this thesis addresses the question of whether presidential political neutrality is a feature that can be influenced by constitutional design, or whether it depends too much on context. I argue that presidential neutrality depends on both constitution and context (where the latter can also be adjusted by the former). First, the political neutrality of presidents depends on the political opportunities that the president faces (where these political opportunities are, in turn, determined by the constellation and relative strength of the government), and, secondly, on the modalities of (indirectly) electing the president. Both factors are equally relevant, but they determine presidential neutrality in different aspects. While lack of political opportunities fosters a politically inactive president, adequate modalities of electing the president (that is, broad support from the government and the opposition) significantly increase the probability of having an impartial (impersonal and objective) president. An impartial president may nevertheless be an independent political agent and vice versa, which is why both the political opportunity framework and modalities of electing the president are relevant to ensure a politically neutral president.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (562k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The key proposition the thesis aims to show is, first, that the presently prevailing sales-based exit strategies in Hungary will continue to produce only modest results and might have negative benefits for the investee and the venture capitalist. Secondly, as the US experiences suggest, more efforts should be invested into the amelioration of the regulatory environment that would make IPO-s more trusted and favored to participants on the VC market. The paper is based on legal literature as well as data provided by the relevant Venture Capital Associations, especially regarding significant IPO-s or sales of startups. The paper views the presented issues mainly from the point of view of the venture capitalist, but the perspective of the investee firm is also taken into consideration during the research. The focus of the paper is on the Hungarian jurisdiction, which is contrasted to the approach to exits reflected in the US. In order to provide a beneficial recommendation for the Hungarian VC investment fund managers I will review the main characteristics of VC funds in Hungary. I will present the most frequently resorted to exit methods and the concomitant exit rights of the investee companyâ€™s shareholders, the tag-along, drag-along, lock-up and buy-back provisions or clauses that can aid the VC manager in structuring the exit of the investment. The paper will tackle the practical advantageous results of the IPO and less advantageous outcomes of the sale, with a special focus on the sale to management. The IPO is a more rewarding avenue, while the sale provides a safer return on the investment of the investors but might lead to drawbacks for the investee and the venture capital experts, too.

However, the understanding of the economic role of stock repurchases and the connected regulatory policies in various legal systems are quite different. As a result, different attitudes lead to the formation of different rules and standards, some of which sometimes seem to be erroneous and inappropriate. Particularly in Azerbaijan, the general perception of share buybacks is different from that in the US. After Azerbaijan gained independence in 1991, capitalism began to emerge in the country, and new concepts such as private property and private company began to appear in society. A sharp transition from socialism to capitalism was reflected in the reform of legislation, but reforms in developing countries are not always successful and sometimes even cause problems. One such problem in Azerbaijan is in the rules regulating the field of corporate finance. In this connection, the dominating line of the present thesis is in revealing solutions to some problematic issues regarding the perception and practical application of share buybacks in Azerbaijan on the example of good experiences and practices of the United States. For this reason, the present thesis focuses on the differences of the legal treatment of stock repurchases in the jurisdictions of the US – the legislation and regulatory policies of the States of Delaware and New York – and the Republic of Azerbaijan (hereinafter: Azerbaijan).

Due to its unique nature, world’s legislators have faced a tough challenge of regulating this field. This issue has been particularly intensified in the field of intellectual property (IP) protection. Software is a creation of the human mind and thus it qualifies for IP protection. However, the IP offices have found it difficult to catch up with the ever-expanding nature of the software. Eligibility of the software for copyright protection is not disputed, however, its patentability is ambiguous. Legal certainty in this field is of an utter importance because software industry needs a consistent legal environment to flourish. An uncertain legal environment undermines its prosperous economic potential, stifles innovation and prevents the effectiveness of the public debates about policy implications. There are several lacunas regarding software patentability rules in the existing systems and the focus of this paper will be the analysis of those rules, identification of the issues and determination of a superior jurisdiction based on the perspective of the legal certainty. The laws of the U.S. and Europe will be analyzed, because large part of the software developers is located in those jurisdictions and also the differences between those systems clearly illustrate the importance and the complicated nature of the topic. The main source of analysis will be the case law of the respective jurisdictions, because, considering the speed this industry evolves at, it’s difficult for the legislation to catch up. The analysis of the jurisdictions will show that both systems lack the certainty and predictability which endangers the software industry as a whole. The paper will briefly discuss the implications of the current approaches. The comparison will conclude that European jurisdiction is superior to the U.S. one, because it offers more certain legal environment.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (536k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) rather arbitrarily and inconsistently takes into account the essential historical context of the continuity of legal and policy repression against the Roma.

Nomination of the arbitrators by the parties may give rise to the problem of lack of independence and impartiality as a result of which the whole arbitration procedure may be adversely affected. The mentioned concern may influence the essence of arbitration itself, since arbitration is meant to serve as the neutral legal tool for the resolution of disputes. The research gap in the mentioned problem is that there is no uniform remedy that could prevent the occurrence of lack of independence and impartiality of party-appointed arbitrators. Jan Paulsson, a renowned arbitration practitioner, is convinced that unilateral appointment causes “moral hazard” to arbitration and proposed the idea of nominating the arbitrators by a neutral body. Other arbitration practitioners, such as Charles N. Brower and Charles B. Rosenberg, are of opposing opinion and support the importance of party-appointments. The objective of this Thesis is to seek for and define an effective remedy on how to prevent the occurrence lack of independence and impartiality of party-appointed arbitrators. This Thesis analyses different remedies such as nomination of arbitrators by a neutral body or their selection from pre-existing list of candidates, improvement of accountability of arbitrators and refinement of the appeal mechanism. The analysis of the above will be aimed at finding the most optimal and potent remedy with the provision of additional recommendations on how such remedy may be implemented in practice. The subsidiary issues and questions stemming from the central research question will focus on discussing the concepts of “independence” and “impartiality” and their standards under the national laws (i.e. UNCITRAL Model Law, U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, English Arbitration Act 1996); discussing the main causes of partiality and bias of arbitrators appointed by the parties. The subsidiary questions will also focus on the analysis of the proposed remedies aimed at preventing the lack of independence and impartiality of party-appointment of arbitrators.

The recent decisions of the Russian Constitutional Court (hereafter RCC) have revealed that under the ""pragmatic"" approach, the RCC is ready to put Putin\'s political objectives above the text of the Constitution. At the same time, the RCC regularly makes quite progressive decisions regarding individual rights complaints, which helped the RCC create the image of credible institutions before society. The credibility of RCC can be beneficial also for Putin\'s regime. The recent judgments of the Kyrgyz Constitutional Chamber suggest that it is actively pursuing the interests of the political leadership and is able to do so through constitutional interpretations tailored to the interests of the regime. Unlike Russia, the Kyrgyz Constitutional Chamber has not been able to find a legal area in which the Chamber would be more autonomous. The attempt of political leadership to use the Constitutional Chamber\'s performance as Russia does in the nearest future will not be surprising. Unlike Russia and Kyrgyzstan, the Georgian Constitutional Court (hereafter GCC) plays a passive role in the advancing of the ruler\'s objectives. It avoids deciding cases of high political interest through stretching the time. Similar to Russia, GCC found a legal area where it was enabled to render comparably progressive decisions. The credibility obtained through these judgments may be used by the GCC itself and political leadership to demonstrate the independence of that institution before domestic actors and international partners. The GCC\'s future strategy will largely depend on who will occupy the position of chairman of the Constitutional Court from the summer of 2020.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1094k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The paper seeks to understand the legal and policy frameworks and practical considerations that inform and drive repatriation projects in the three countries. This thesis examines how voluntary repatriation projects in the selected countries are in keeping with the threshold laid down by law. It also examines the practice in light of UNHCR guidelines that complement the legal framework. The thesis establishes the normative framework on repatriation and explores the legal provisions on repatriation at the international and national levels. It highlights the conditions necessary for voluntary repatriation and proceeds to examine the practices in each of the three countries: Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. To identify points of convergence in practice as well as good practices surrounding repatriation, the thesis utilizes a comparative approach. The analysis is aimed at identifying areas for reform in as far as ensuring sound refugee protection in the quest for durable solutions. The analysis concludes that although Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are signatories to the Refugee Convention as well as the OAU Convention and have enacted domestic laws on refugee protection, these laws have not been implemented to the latter. Voluntariness in repatriation exercises has not been fully achieved and as such these organised returns are fraught with human right violations, fall short of the threshold set by law and in some instances have amounted to refoulement. The thesis recommends the adoption of comprehensive repatriation programmes that are informed by human rights based approach to refugee protection. The thesis posits that refugees should participate in making their own return decisions or seeking alternative options. The research recommends the setting up of Quadripartite Commissions to replace Tripartite Arrangements between countries of origin, country of asylum and UNHCR. As the fourth estate, refugees would proactively engage in the returns process and guarantee voluntariness. The research advances alternative options for refugees who do not wish to repatriate mobility for labour reasons and cross-border mobility arrangements for refugees where naturalization is not feasible. The thesis further recommends that UNHCR and countries intending to invoke cessation clauses must ensure the threshold has been met. The thesis in conclusion underscores the significance of voluntariness in repatriation efforts and acknowledges the inherent potential of states to respect human rights and uphold refugee protection.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (413k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The present thesis aims to provide an overview on the issue of suspicion, mere suspicion of the non-conformity of the goods to the contract under Article 35 and the German speaking courts. The analysis will focus on what constitutes the suspicion of non-conformity of the goods, mainly ‘food’, and whether or not it can actually amount to non- conformity of the goods, after having retracted the two possibilities of establishing suspicions and the relevant case law, I will concentrate on the German speaking courts’ interpretation of this issue. The latter courts took two different approaches, the majority sided with the fact that suspicions of non-conformity indeed constitute non-conformity while the rest believes that suspicions will never amount to non-conformity. The evaluation will proceed focusing on the burden of proof and whether the buyer can actually prove the suspicions of non-conformity or cannot prove it under the CISG.  The discussion will then delve into which approach of the German speaking courts is more permissive and convincing. In other words, I will present my own assessment regarding both approaches concluding my analysis with the decision that the suspicion mere suspicion, per se, amounts to non-conformity and a breach of contract under Art 35 CISG.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (433k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Alongside the broader human rights debate of whether there really exists a right to access to safe abortions for women, issues like this raise a question of how the reproductive autonomy and freedom of choice accorded to women from such access are further constrained when considering the gender of her offspring. The study aims to examine the practice of sex-selective abortions within the broader international human rights context, with special focus on the rights of the women. The study will compare the legal systems of Nepal, China and India and how the prevalence of this practice in their societies has been aided or addressed by their national legislation and state policies, and how it fits with their existing international human rights obligations.

Given the above, I believe it is important to demonstrate what can be accomplished through the use of SHAs, specifically focusing on problems related to the inter-generational transfer of wealth and allocation of control. The latter is one of the burning issues Croatian companies are facing since most of them were formed in the second half of 1990s, and, today, the founders of these companies have reached or are reaching retirement. As a consequence, companies are facing a universal problem: what will happen to the company in the case of a change in control? In this thesis, I canvas the laws and experiences of the U.S., currently one of the most developed legal systems in this respect, and show how SHAs could, as a special instrument, contribute to the growth of businesses and through that to the Croatian economy. What I demonstrate is that Croatia should take advantage of the extensive U.S. practices related to SHAs and start exploiting them as a powerful tool to overcome the issues related to inter-generational transfer of wealth and allocation of control. Using a comparative analysis, I portrait relevant Croatian and U.S. laws and practices, with particular focus on pertaining U.S. cases which Croatia could directly benefit from and which could serve as a benchmark even for drafting prescriptive Croatian laws that would not just impose (mandatory) obligations on but also guide legal subjects.

The main goal of the private equity investors is to make an investment into a promising investee firm, to which institutional banks do not give a loan, with the expectation of future returns. Often, they form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) typically in the form of limited partnership, through which they invest money into the investee firm to limit their liability. The investments are always made for a limited period time. Consequently, it is essential for private equity firms to easily exit the investment, possibly with profits or with minimal losses. Generally, there are more avenues to exit, simpler and more complex ones, from initial public offerings (IPO) and secondary sales – where the private equity investor decides to sell the business to a different investor , to trade sales – where the company is sold to another company, often to bigger corporations seeking “market share”. The thesis is, however, devoted to exit through tag along and drag along clauses within the context of the US law, as a jurisdictions possessing mature laws on and ample experiences with these. The analysis aims, on the one hand, to critically asses what dilemmas and other practical issues faced by investors when applying them, and on the other hand, to propose possible solutions for the detected problems. The result of the research denotes that though there are several ways to exit the investments, tag along and drag along clauses are considered to be the most effective and straightforward routes because they create balance between the interest of the majority stockholders in the company and the interest of the minority. Moreover, they prevent emergence of deadlocks and abuses of the rights of any party, as well as are tools for achieving the parties’ exit goals. Whenever the majority or the minority decides to sell its stake, the majority drags along the minority stockholders to exit, by forcing them to similarly, sell their stocks to a different investor on the same terms, at the same time. Whereas if the majority stockholders decide to sell their stake, the tag along clause grants the right to the minority shareholders to participate in the transaction and sell its stocks at the same terms, at the same price, thus obliging the third party to buy the minority stocks as well. Therefore, the tag along and drag along clauses shall be taken into consideration by the private equity investors.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1152k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

However, the gap between promises made and realities on the ground is huge. Running counter to the patriarchal society, a few local NGOs established women shelters in 2003, funded by international donors. Women victims of violence since 2003 found refuge and support in the form of shelters. Today, with the shrinking footprints of international donors, these shelters are at risk of closure. This is especially worrying as the Afghan government pursuant to U.S.-Taliban deal, is proceeding towards negotiations with Taliban. Considering, the past experience with Taliban, one can conclude that Taliban are not champions of equal rights of men and women. These shelters, seen as foreign impositions need support in order to assist women in need. This thesis is a reminder to the Afghan State to not forget it’s international and national human rights obligations in responding violence against women by suggesting few recommendations, drawing upon lessons learned from Indonesia. To do this, first it is important to understand the process of development of state’s obligation under international human rights to provide integrated services including shelters and then the legal framework of the states. The realities on the ground will reveal the difference between the promise made and the status quo. The Afghan State must ensure, women’s well-being today and for the years to come.

The first endeavour is to answer question what exactly are these central intervention mechanisms. Then this paper attempts to decipher the reason why these provisions are included in these countries.

Some states define the term ""investment"" too broadly in order to create a friendly investment environment, which is hardly correct from the point of view of protecting the interests of the state receiving the investment. The broad concept of foreign investment raises a debate about the effectiveness of economic development in the host state since international investment treaties entitle foreign investors who do not even bring any contributions to the economy of the host state, with the right to sue the state. Due to certain circumstances, developing States receive more investment claims than the contribution to the economy of the host state. The Kyrgyz Republic is a party to many investment protection treaties. In these treaties, the concept of investor is defined broadly, and pays more attention to protecting the interests of the investor and creating investment guarantees, and has less interest of the state itself. Many investors already have lawsuits against the Kyrgyz Republic, using the state\'s investment legislation. The qualification of the concept of investment plays a key role in the resolution by arbitrators of the subject matter jurisdiction ratione materiae of the International Settlement Investment Disputes (ISID).

The quintessential issue is whether laws used for secured credit should apply to title security in Russia given that functionally both secure credits? The question is legitimate for two main reasons. On one hand, all the leading common law jurisdictions have subjected title finance transactions to the same legal regime that applies also to secured credit. Moreover, some civil countries have taken steps in that direction, too. The prototype of this unitary model is enshrined into Article (chapter) 9 of the US Uniform Commercial Code. On the other hand, most of title security transactions in Russia today are concluded in the form of sale and lease agreements, and, consequently, the laws on ‘sales’ or conventional ‘lease’ contracts apply by analogy. These laws, however, often produce inequitable and results ill-suited to modern business needs as they were not formulated having title security in sight. At the same time, the laws on secured credit address all the necessary issues that could arise during its use more appropriately. Due to the absence of necessary uniform rules, court practice is forced to find suitable solutions and fill these gaps in legislature. The current situation has an adverse effect for parties of title security agreements the security nature of which is uncertain. Consequently, the main argument of the thesis is that the analogous application of sale and conventional lease regulation is inadequate and negatively affects access to credit. It rather vouches for such a more balanced regulation of these transactions which would take into account the interests of all stakeholders and is thus the model Russia should embrace as well. To support these arguments, the thesis juxtaposes the laws and experiences of jurisdictions exemplifying the two approaches. On one side, this includes the conventional dualistic approach of English law (as supplemented by UK law, if any) and the Romano-Germanic jurisdictions (to the latter group Russia belongs to as well), which continue to treat title finance separately from secured credit. As opposed to that, the analysis is based on international guidelines, particularly Book IX of the Draft Common Frame of Reference and the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions, both of which were heavily influenced by the unitary approach of US law.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (476k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

This thesis highlights the existing international human rights framework and argues that Kenya is failing in its regional and international law obligations by allowing the existence of criminalisation provisions in the Penal Code.

With the increase in need and purpose of their involvement in arbitration procedures, party-appointed experts are expected to meet various professional requirements and obligations. The need to bring fairness in the arbitral proceedings especially requires experts to be independent and impartial. Moreover, since party-appointed experts are chosen by the parties, involved in various arbitral proceedings repeatedly, and has some sort of professional and personal relationships with parties and members of the tribunal, it is possible to doubt their independence and impartiality. Hence, the main thrust of this paper is to explore the ethical requirements that need to be met by a party-appointed expert in general and the specific standards of independence and impartiality that can be used by arbitrators to determine the independence and impartiality of party-appointed experts. This being the aim, it also investigates whether noncompliance with such ethical requirements will cause their challenge and whether a tribunal has the power to decide upon such a challenge. In doing so, the paper finds out that the duty of independence and impartiality of party-appointed experts has not been expressly stipulated in the binding laws of international arbitration. However, such an obligation can be inferred from the non-binding rules as well as the fundamental principles of international arbitration. It also finds that there are no specific standards of independence and impartiality of party-appointed experts. Based on the analyses of relevant literature and different case law, the researcher argued that tribunals have the power to decide upon a challenge and exclude them based on lack of independence and impartiality. However, such a possibility is being challenged due to the non-existence of specific standards that could help tribunals to use to assess the independence and impartiality of party-appointed experts. For this reason, tribunals are not excluding party-appointed experts despite the existence of some circumstances that create doubt on their impartiality. Therefore, this gap needs a thought from the eyes of the laws. Consequently, the paper acknowledges the need for a specific guideline on the standards of independence and impartiality and recommends for the analogous application of IBA guidelines on conflict of interest in international arbitration for a party-appointed expert. In doing so, the paper emphasizes giving proper consideration of the differences.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (393k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

The US and the EU has generally recognized the arbitrability of antitrust disputes through its case law. However, it is ambiguous and controversial in China whether arbitral tribunals can arbitrate the antitrust disputes under a valid arbitration agreement. The antitrust law keeps silent on this issue and some courts recognized the arbitrability of these disputes while other courts denied. By denying the arbitrability of antitrust issues in China, partiesâ€™ intention to seek a quick and effective arbitral award is destroyed. Under such background, it is of great significance to explore whether the antitrust issues should be or can be arbitrable in China. The core question of the thesis is to analyze whether antitrust claims are arbitrable in China. The thesis analyzes the ambiguity of the legal framework of China on this issue and explores the possibility to arbitrate such disputes under current legal framework. In addition to that, another aim of the thesis is to justify the arbitrability of antitrust issue in China from the comparative perspectives of the US and the EU on the issue of the arbitrability of antitrust claims. The thesis holds the view that the antitrust dispute is arbitrable in China. The methodology that the thesis adopts is comparative analysis, mainly by comparing the approaches of the US and the EU and applying such approaches to analyze the current practices of Chinese courts.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (499k)', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer', 'Local note': 'ETD'}"

Remarkable divergences emerge from the evolving legislation, case law and scholarship when it comes to identify the purpose of copyright in the EU. The dissertation takes up the challenge of paving the way towards a tighter connection between the legislation and its stated objectives, with the aim of tracing an analytical trajectory towards a sustainable harmonization. The study builds on a historical, textual and content analysis of the law, unveiling the multifunctional nature of EU copyright law. The identified functions show a predominant economic nature, which leads to embrace the economic analysis to further inquire into the underlying, implicit objectives. The resulting picture displays a consolidated intent of the EU legislator to avoid copyright overprotection and underprotection, both deemed inefficient and socially undesirable scenarios. Within the limits imposed by this twofold warning, EU copyright law seeks a constant calibration of its own functions, essentially aiming at a fair distribution of copyright-generated income and information in society. In this vein, the adoption of a distributive analytical framework is suggested to be an effective move towards a function-based assessment of EU copyright law. Focusing on fair remuneration, co-authorship and teaching exception, the framework proves effective in highlighting convergences and divergences between the promised legislative objectives and the expected outcomes of the economic analysis, opening a window towards further positive as well as normative analysis of the current state and future developments in the EU copyright scene.', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2064k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Restricted access for 3 years'}"

Prior studies mainly approach African constitutionalism through either legal centralism or legal pluralism. While the former understands and explains African constitutionalism from the perspective of the state, the latter sees it from the lens of the state and society. On the one side of the spectrum, the legal centralist approach fails to account to the empirical realities of the state and ignores the role and function of indigenous laws in the constitution and operation of the African state. On the other side of the spectrum, the legal pluralist approach misinterprets the nature of the African state and its configuration with the society. By situating the phenomenology of African constitutionalism in the experiences, interactions, and contestations of power and governance in precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial times, and by building on religious studies and anthropology, this dissertation introduces legal syncretism as a theoretical framework for a better understanding of African constitutionalism. Legal syncretism captures and explains the transformation of African constitutionalism from precolonial times to the present, and the consequent constitutional designs and practices in theoretically defensible and practically sound ways. On the one hand, legal syncretism explains how precolonial constitutionalism in Africa came to an end with the entry of international law and colonial laws in the late nineteenth century, how colonial constitutionalism reconfigured and transformed precolonial constitutional rules and practices, and how postcolonial constitutionalism grapples with the continuous affirmation and, at the same time, negation of liberal constitutionalism. On the other hand, legal syncretism offers a novel theoretical framework to look at the nature of the African state, its vertical and horizontal government organizations, and its conception of constitutional rights. Along with these constitutional developments and practices, legal syncretism presents the nature, travails, pathologies, and incremental successes of African constitutionalism in time and space more clearly. By taking federalism, the executive, and womenâ€™s rights as themes of analysis and Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa as comparative case studies, this dissertation tests and demonstrates how legal syncretism animates and permeates African constitutional designs and practices. By doing so, it shows the convergences and divergences between African constitutionalism and liberal constitutionalism. By transcending the impasse between legal centralism and legal pluralism, legal syncretism not only offers a better theoretical framework to understand the nature, identity, and manifestations of African constitutionalism, but it also provides some useful theoretical and practical insights for its assessment and improvement.', 'Access': 'PDF file (2877k)'}"

The mysterious nature of the doctrine of public policy and its role in international commercial arbitration itself carves out a case for an in depth examination, contributing to both theory and practice. The elements of uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity attributed to public policy have, at times, significantly impeded the functionality of international commercial arbitration, in general, and undermined the foundations of the New York Convention, in particular. Public policy doctrine can play a noteworthy role throughout the process of arbitration; right from the conclusion of arbitration agreement followed by arbitral proceedings to the setting aside and enforcement stage, it is almost omnipresent. And at every stage it can influence the process in a manner that can have a significant impact on the celebrated features of international commercial arbitration, i.e. party autonomy and finality of arbitral awards.  The thesis provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex role that public policy plays in international commercial arbitration at various stages. For that it begins by delving into the genesis of the concept of public policy and its evolution in the field of private international law. Building on that, the thesis explores the manner in which national courts use public policy as a tool at different stages of arbitration to intervene for various reasons.  The major portion of the thesis examines the role of public policy as an exception to enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. It examines the understanding of public policy exception as envisaged by the New York Convention, and how national courts from across the jurisdictions have responded to it. The focus remains on the diverging approaches followed by the national courts, where on the one hand pro-enforcement policy has been favored and on the other hand courts have preferred an interventionist approach. For the purpose of comparison, the erratic position of the national courts of India on interpretation and application of public policy exception is probed and compared with the approach adopted by the more arbitration friendly courts of England, Singapore, and the United States.  The thesis aims at contributing to the scholarship by identifying the key issues in concern and suggesting a pragmatic approach to deal with them. Keeping in mind the significance of harmonization, if not uniformity, in context of interpretation and application of public policy exception, it lays a road map for jurisdictions like India that are criticized for being too intrusive, with a hope of guiding them to adopt a more arbitration friendly approach.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2360k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The main areas discussed in this research include (1) the elements that prevail in assessing torture claims, i.e. severity and intention&purpose, and how they are determined in the case law; (2) other factors that can be taken into account and their consequences on the definition of torture and on the overall evolution of the torture case law; (3) whether there is a uniform view of what amounts to torture in the context of interrogations; (4) the evolution of the threshold for torture in interrogations. The dissertation shows that severity is the element that prevails in the definition of torture, while purpose and intention are merely secondary elements, placed somewhere in the background. With regard to pain and suffering specific of severe ill-treatment, the study shows how a quantitative approach (the effects on the victim expressed by the amount and gravity of injuries or the number of acts inflicted) has been largely the main criteria for determining the severity of an ill-treatment and its overall qualification of torture. Other criteria include the cruel nature of an ill-treatment and, gradually gaining in importance, the vulnerability of the victim, two criteria which render secondary the classic elements of the definition of torture. The dissertation also shows that the quantification method used in interpreting “severe pain or suffering” has pushed the uniform agreement on what amounts to torture towards higher thresholds of pain or suffering. While recent developments give more meaning to psychological suffering and to the victim’s vulnerability the overall threshold for torture remains elevated. It is concluded that for legal purposes, the UN definition of torture is a well done construct and that it is the case law that should give more substance to the principles and ideals that inspired the prohibition of torture, an issue that becomes more obvious in seemingly borderline cases.', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2921k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The new statute was based on the EU competition law model, in accordance with the recommendations of the EU Commission. The law reform was rather unusual, not only because it reintroduced competition law seven years after abolishing the existing antimonopoly law and closing down the Antimonopoly Service, but also because it was immediately followed by the abolishment of the law on consumers rights protection, effectively eliminating consumer law and its enforcement system in Georgia. This dissertation uses the case of Georgia and conducts a comparative analysis of the EU and Georgian legal systems, to demonstrate the impossibility to foster market competition, maintain its high level and enforce competition law and antitrust policies fruitfully, in the absence of consumer law. According to a widely shared opinion, a high level of market competition is in the interests of consumers, as it delivers to them low prices, good quality and a wide selection of goods and services. Contrary to this belief, this work argues that while market competition has immense potential, the mere liberalisation of markets and introduction of competition do not guarantee any benefits for consumers, unless the process is accompanied by effective consumer protection policies.  Consumers fail to take advantages of competitive market structure. Moreover, neither market competition can be successfully maintained, nor competition law enforced without actively engaging consumers. The latter hold a critical role in daily market operations and in competition law enforcement. However, consumers are not naturally prepared and equipped with suitable skills for this role. The average consumer is a weak, irrational thinker, can be easily manipulated, and lacks knowledge and confidence to protect her interests. It is the goal of consumer law to turn her into a market actor who can contribute to competition with their rational behaviour and actively participate in the law enforcement process as well.  In order to verify this assumption, the research analyses substantive, procedural and institutional aspects of competition and consumer laws. It identifies consumer welfare as one of the primary objectives of competition law, and employs comparative-historic analysis to explore the rationale of consumer law, criticising the narrowness of the legal notion of consumers, for leaving all the non-human actors out of the regulations. The research relies on the finding of behavioural law and economics and challenges the mainstream consumer image for being unrealistic. It examines procedures through which consumers can participate and contribute to competition law enforcement process, and seeks to define the optimal institutional design for the enforcement authority in Georgia, after advocating for and predicting the inevitable reintroduction of consumer law.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (3676k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

Since investment disputes involve matters of public interest, granting public access to certain aspects of the arbitral proceedings ensures that members of the citizenry have the opportunity to be informed of the matters in dispute, as well as to be heard on these issues if the outcome potentially affects them. A palpable move towards increased transparency in investment arbitration has resulted in the revision of institutional arbitral rules, a set of rules devoted entirely to transparency, and even a convention. This dissertation evaluates the movement for increased transparency in investor-State dispute settlement – with a focus on investment treaty arbitration – and critique the efficacy of the transparency measures currently in place. This study also proposes recommendations for further enhancing the transparency of investment arbitration, by highlighting emerging issues that have yet to be examined from a transparency paradigm. This dissertation aims to operationalize the concept of transparency for international investment arbitration, by determining: (1) what information must be made accessible; (2) who is obliged to make such information accessible; (3) who is entitled to access such information; (4) how the information can be accessed; (5) when and where access must be granted; and (6) why the information must be accessible. The exceptions to the above also form part of the analysis in this dissertation, because a balanced approach to transparency is preferred to an absolute one. The exceptions to transparency are expressed in the texts of rules and the arbitral decisions discussed throughout this dissertation; a study of this material attests to the delicate task of finding an appropriate balance of transparency and confidentiality. This dissertation examines transparency from different angles: the transparency of the investor-State dispute settlement system towards the public, the transparency owed by the actors within the system towards the arbitral process, and the effects of transparency on these actors. The literature on transparency has heretofore focused on the first angle almost exclusively.

In order to answer my research question about the role of trials related to politics (‘political trials’) in the context of transitioning from state repression to the Rule of Law, I have conducted case studies of trials against political parties, acting or former politicians in four jurisdictions. The assessment of relevant court proceedings in Germany, Austria, Ukraine and Belarus confirms my hypothesis that ‘political trials’ in the transitional post-Soviet states are different from those conducted in Western Europe due to unwritten Soviet practices of politicized justice employed by post-Soviet ruling elites to remove formidable, popular political opponents. The undertaken research is novel, because it offers the analysis of politically motivated justice from a comparative legal perspective, while existing previous research has been limited to individual cases and missed identifying common characteristics of political trials in the former communist bloc. After studying extensive academic literature on the communist totalitarian system of justice, my research project names main types of politically motivated trials from the early Soviet Union until its late years as well as core unwritten practices of politicized justice that led to the split of the Soviet legal system into two parallel orders of formal and informal rules. It further introduces the novel theoretical concept of ‘Twofold Constitutionalism’, which helps better understand the interaction between formal written norms and unwritten political practices.  The legal assessment of the communist traditions of politically motivated justice is very timely. In various republics of the former Soviet Union numerous opposition politicians, political rivals and government critics continue facing blatant violations of their constitutional rights and freedoms in criminal proceedings that look similar to notorious Stalinist show trials against the so-called ‘people’s enemies’. The absence of necessary reforms, weak democratic institutions, the lack of independent judiciary and no meaningful decommunization process still keep the unresolved issue of politically motivated trials and their Soviet practices on the democratization agenda of many post-Soviet states. The main contribution of this research is that it offers a list of prima-facie criteria to assess future allegations about politically motivated justice at various stages of criminal proceedings in the former Soviet Union. While the criteria cannot be used to categorically classify a trial as ‘politicized’ or ‘fair’, they rather offer a guidance what elements of criminal proceedings one should focus on to study the complex phenomenon of politicized justice.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (3378k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The possibility of altering DNA containing the genetic information of life, at the pre-implantation embryonic level, and its immutable consequences, legal and ethical, raises significant questions that make it not only relevant, but urgent, to embed into the fundamental tailoring of legal systems. The engagement with such technologies is imbued with the plurality of human choice and selection, making concerns about eugenic outcomes a reasonable one. The aim of this dissertation, therefore, is to navigate towards a deeper understanding of possible legal approaches that may be deployed to govern future pre-implantation genetic interventions. Through a methodological comparison of legal frameworks in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Thailand, the dissertation explores the underlying philosophical, socio-legal, cultural and ethical reasonings (in each jurisdiction) to not only justify legal genetic interventions, but to also critically understand the points at which different governments are willing to regulate biomedical technologies (‘the entry points of regulation’). By breaking through barriers to bring together considerations for a more internationalized global biomedical approach, this dissertation emphasizes the necessity to unlearn three key biases and misconceptions (which may also overlap with the key findings). These include: firstly, the divorcing of eugenics understanding from a specific historical event, and a reinterpretation of eugenics in contemporary settings; secondly, dismantling the narrative of fear and disconcert about these kinds of biomedical technologies; and thirdly, revisiting and employing an alternative understanding of universality in the international human rights corpus.  Using the backdrop of international biomedical laws, individual constitutional systems and a variety of regulatory approaches that may be suitable to govern future pre-implantation genetic interventions, the findings in this dissertation advances three major points. Firstly, to reinterpret the meaning of eugenics in contemporary settings, and to make distinctions that would differentiate practices that may have eugenic outcomes, especially where pre-implantation genetic interventions are concerned. Secondly, to focus on strong governance, stable legal and/or regulatory frameworks and concise international outlooks in formulating the governance of future pre-implantation genetic interventions. Besides the traditional command-and-control top-down governance through positivist black letter law (which may be inadequate to deal with the advancement of technologies), the dissertation proposes the use of variable regulatory approaches (in complementarity with existing frameworks) that take inspiration from contemporary regulatory designs, such as responsible research innovation and legal foresighting, smart regulation and responsive regulation; as well as adaptive governance, and agency models. Thirdly, to use the proposed ‘entry points of regulation’ to update the definition of universality in internationalized human rights corpus, and a renegotiation of a common shared values system, that may be incorporated into different constitutional systems.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2713k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

Access to finance is evaluated as a measure of obtaining credit with ease, cost-efficiency and transparency, especially in the taking and realization of the security interest in a collateral. Ideally, security interests in personal property ought to be created and enforced with maximum flexibility, predictability and optimal cost, devoid of delays and redundant formalities. In addition, there must exist appropriate risk mitigation and public notice safeguards for all the relevant parties, including other creditors, whether secured or unsecured, and interested third parties including the good faith purchaser. Accordingly, this research examines the continuing PPSL reforms in the Africa, with Sierra Leone as the case study. It evaluates the reformed legal framework, inclusive of the new Sierra Leone Borrowers and Lenders Act 2014 (BLA), in determining whether it supports the economic function of facilitating expanded access to credit finance. Prior to the enactment of the BLA, the fragmented, limiting and obsolete nature of the PPSL framework made the cost of credit prohibitively high, particularly so for small and mid-scale enterprises (SMEs). The BLA adopts the functional approach to personal property security with the aim of stimulating economic growth by expanding the collateral range and improving the public notice regime. This research, however, asserts that the BLA substantial deviates from the paradigm functional and unitary model, and is fraught with ‘legal inefficiency’, thereby leading to a defective framework. The analyses are focused on the substantial deviations: First, the Central Bank’s extended regulatory supervision and intrusion in the market, the restrictive definition of lenders and the economic implications of a banking oligopoly in the secured credit market. Second, the retention of old English law corporate charges, the floating security dilemma, and the place of the purchase money security interest (PMSI) in the new framework. Third, the existences and impact of the two parallel systems for secured credit in Sierra Leone, legal parallelism in the two-tier framework, one for banking and other licensed financial institutions and the other for non-banking creditors within the same legal order.  The substantial deviations notwithstanding, this research further claims that the BLA also affords the opportunity for the use of hitherto new security devices which will support the economic function of facilitating access to credit, including; optimizing agricultural finance given the agrarian nature of the economy in Sierra Leone; receivables and inventory financing for SMEs growth; and title financing, owing to its economic advantages especially for consumer finance and unique treatment in insolvency. The research proposes a rethink of the reform in Sierra Leone with comparative perspectives from the England and the United States. Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the US is considered to be the paradigm functional framework, whilst English law forms the basis of the pre-reform PPSL formal approach to personal property security in Sierra Leone. This comparative approach is also suggestive of reshaping the reform in Sierra Leone through the theoretical lens of the law and development movement and legal transplant theory, given the influence of the international financial institutions (IFIs) in the global law reform movement. The reform in Sierra Leone presents a substantive case to evaluate the merits (or otherwise) of the law reformist agenda of the IFIs within the field of secured transactions law.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (3817k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The essence of retooling the regime is to better help facilitate the restructuring of such businesses, putting them in a position to return to profitability in such a way that best balances the rights and claims of its stakeholders. Critical to this process is the availability of new financing, first in the interim to keep the business going and then also to help it implement a workable restructuring plan. It cannot be gainsaid that the availability of new financing may determine the success or otherwise of the restructuring efforts. Lending by itself presupposes some risks. This riskiness is further exacerbated by the fact of financial distress. Intuitively, lending to distressed businesses will not be ordinarily typical for providers of financing. This has spurred the growing need to incentivize providers of financing to distressed businesses. On the flipside, it has also informed the need to check possible overreaching, occasioned by new financing whether by pre-distress lenders or by new lenders who for various reasons are now becoming the face of distress lending.  These issues are addressed in this dissertation on a comparative basis, analyzing the approaches in the US, UK and Germany and drawing lessons for frontier markets like Nigeria which is at the threshold of reworking its bankruptcy regime in the light of the growing acceptance of restructuring as an important part of the that regime. The Nigerian analysis is of relevance to similarly placed frontier markets.  The dissertation investigates and shows that jurisdictional approaches to statutory incentivizing of new financing differ along the lines of two articulated approaches: a prescriptive approach on the one hand, and a market-based approach on the other. Thus, while on the one hand, there is a prescriptive approach, which spells out defined explicit rules for providing new financing, protection for prior lenders, on the other hand, there is a market-based approach, which emphasizes the role of the market as the better judge of when a distressed lender may be incentivized, how the incentives may be designed, and what concession prior lenders may be willing to make. In the face of these two competing approaches to incentivizing new lending, the dissertation examines the underlying indices that support this divergence in the articulated approaches.  The dissertation further investigates the use of new financing agreements as instruments of lender capture, given their implications for other stakeholders of the business. In this regard, the dissertation critically examines the theoretical justifications for the key provisions of such agreements and, on a comparative basis, existing principles that can be used to countermand overreaching provisions of such agreements.  Finally, while pointing out the role of the distressed debt market as a source of distressed financing with growing importance, the dissertation argues that courts can play a key role in balancing the misalignments that can arise from the participation of distressed debt investors as financers in the restructuring process. In a related sense, the dissertation critically examines the manifestation of the distressed debt market in emerging markets like Nigeria and the opportunity presented through non-performing loans, arguing that the regulatory pattern of entry into the market may dis-incentivize distress debt investing in a market that is in dire need of financing.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2894k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The central argument of this proposal is that there is a need to rethink the Convention on the Rights Per-sons Disability Committees (hereafter CRPD) abolitionist perspective on mental health legislations that sanction the use of civil commitment process and call for the promotion of and the use of effective protective substantive and procedural standards to curb abuse and arbitrary detentions in accessing mental health care access and services as provided in various facilities. The dissertation claims that civil commitment with its challenges is a useful method for certain individuals in certain circumstance in the access of mental health care. It is legislatively recognized as an accepted method of providing treatment in the four countries mental health framework and beyond. Howev-er, arbitrariness and abuse of rights as evidenced by the prevalent historical and current documenta-tion on abuse of human rights of persons with mental disabilities, makes it an inadequate process. As a consequence of the abuse, the thesis concedes that it is reasonably justified to have the call on the absolute ban of civil commitment of persons with mental disability, presently implemented through the prohibition of deprivation of liberty based on a disability by the paradigm changing treaty- the CRPD and the strong anti-civil commitment standpoint of the CRPD Committee. The Committee calls upon States to reform their mental health legislations that allow for “involuntary commitment of persons with disabilities in mental health institutions based on actual or perceived impairment” because “involuntary commitment of persons with disabilities on health care grounds contradicts the absolute ban on deprivation of liberty on the basis of impairments (article 14(1)(b))[right to liberty and security of person] and the principle of free and informed consent of the person concerned for health care (article 25[right to health]).” The alternatives proposed by the Committee include access to and use of mental health voluntarily services, deinstitutionalization and providing mental health care services within the communities. However, current State practices in many jurisdictions contradict these calls by continuing to sanction civil commitment in their mental health legislation with more substantive and procedural standards. The practice also shows slow deinstitutionalization processes but more of refurbishment of institutions and slow establish-ment of community mental health services. At the same time, in many jurisdictions, mental health care remains to be the least funded and staffed. Care and treatment continues to be provided in de-prived infrastructure environment and where arbitrary detentions and abuse remain prevalent. The prevalence of abuse and arbitrary detentions continue to manifest in mental health hospitals, psy-chiatric facilities, and care homes, traditional and spiritual mental health centers prevalent in many African and Asian countries including our private homes. The conclusion that can be drawn from all these, is an indication of disparity between the requirements of the Convention, State practice and the stark reality of many human rights violations taking place in respective domestic jurisdictions. Therefore, for these reasons there is an overriding imperativeness for researching standards and to persuasively engage the CRPD Committee towards rethinking its absolute prohibitionist perspective and to accept standards as an alternative to its current position and a solution to the ongoing problem of human rights abuse and arbitrariness.', 'Access': 'PDF file (3396k)'}"

The sufficient availability of credit to business entities especially the small and medium scale entrepreneurs (SMEs) is interconnected with the nature of a country’s legal framework on secured transactions. A modern secured transactions law entails the use of personal property to secure credit, while an unreformed one – like Nigeria’s, amongst other shortcomings like lack of public notification system, focuses mainly on the use of real property as collateral. This is however a big problem and quite unsuitable for economic development because most SMEs and other forms of business organizations in Nigeria may not always have sufficient real property collateral to secure credit – and as a result, do not always meet up with credit requirements from banks and other lending institutions. A secured transactions law which allows for the use of personal property as collateral, provides comprehensive rules of creation, perfection, priority, as well as judicial and self-help enforcement channels, creates confidence in lending by ultimately ensuring predictability, which no doubt makes credits sufficiently available for entrepreneurs. Nigerian secured transactions law lacks the main features of a modern one because it provides no detailed rules (from creation to enforcement) on the non-possessory use of personal property to secure credit. It is not yet fully recognized in Nigeria how much detrimental it is that its secured transactions law is compartmentalized – what inherently makes the system unpredictable and not trustworthy to financiers. The summary effect of all this is that there is no sufficient flow of credit in the economy and this leads to economic underdevelopment. This thesis therefore seeks to come forward with solutions that might significantly address some of Nigeria’s economic problems, especially those that emanate from insufficient availability of credit. In looking for solutions, the thesis takes a critical look at the UCC Article 9, and is of the firm view that its unitary structure could offer a good example for Nigeria to follow in the reform of its secured transactions law. However, rather than rely exclusively on the US law, the thesis also takes a critical look at the Ontario Personal Property Security Act because in many respects, Canadian (Ontario) laws and the linked economic structures used to be closer to Nigeria’s than those of the US. It is therefore the position of this thesis, that through a comparative analysis that points out the commonalities and discrepancies between the two systems, the thesis will analyze those elements of UCC Article 9 and Ontario PPSA that could conveniently be adapted to suit Nigeria’s local conditions. The idea is not to suggest the unaltered transplantation of the more suitable version of any one institution or rule, but rather to see why there was a need to, and how the Canadians managed to adjust the US transplants to local conditions – this comparative analysis would hopefully offer valuable tools to the Nigerian lawmakers towards the reform of Nigeria’s secured transactions law.'}"

Where justified claims are systematically thrown out by both political and judicial bodies, that marks a failure of the legal system to live up to the expectations of law that protects all equally. The thesis argues that there is an area where the rejection of minority rights claims is illegitimate and where a solution is available that does not challenge the basic structure of states and legal systems. I present a proposal that builds on a type of judicial procedure, collective procedures or group litigation, in order to bridge the gap between minority claims that have a decisive collective element and the tendency in many legal systems to screen out such claims as non-enforceable. The proposal covers claims from more past-centered, historical injustice claims, often based on large-scale crimes, to present-day discrimination claims including desegregation in education and language use. The fact, however, that the proposal seeks accommodation without challenging the overall setup means that many autonomy related claims, most importantly territorial autonomy and self-determination, might fall outside the scope of the thesis. The adoption of a rule allowing for collective procedures, if it targets or is also applicable to the types of claims raised by minorities, will help expand the ability of law and the courts to engage, in more meaningful ways, with minority claims. More specifically, the proposal seeks to expand the ability of the legal system to consider claims, arguments, proof and context that go beyond a strictly individualist approach. The proposal brings important benefits like better access to justice, allowing a challenge to wider social practices and statistical evidence on group-level that is not easy to translate to proof on the individual level; judicial efficiency; contextualization that can tame hidden biases; recognition and empowerment, giving voice to victims. Judicial group recognition offers various ways to address individual and intragroup variation. This will limit the possible dangers of full and permanent recognition of groups, most importantly the possible limiting effect on group members, in line with liberal multiculturalist accounts. The procedural approach avoids the sensitive question of ‘collective minority rights’ while allowing the enforcement of claims that can only be construed on the level of groups. The thesis is meant to be a contribution to bridging the gap between minority claims, framed as group rights, and minority rights limited to individuals. While the thesis seeks to preserve the individual-based liberal view, maintaining that it is ultimately on the individual level that we should measure the benefits of rights enforcement, the expansion of rights enforcement can link back to how rights are conceived. Once rights with an important collective element are endorsed in judicial awards, that can reinforce the group context of rights even for those who are otherwise unwilling to depart from a strict individualist reading of rights.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2984k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

It was assumed that one of the modern justifications of the civil legal aid that gives an expansive approach stems from the human rights rationale. Before revealing and elaborating on the above mentioned theoretical assumption the project starts with an incursion into history in order to highlight how and why legal aid appeared and which social factors and actors stood behind this institution. Then the research proceeds with the identification of the answer given today to civil legal aid by the so-called century of human rights. The analysis of Chapter two is first taken into a review of different legal principles, which are found in the international human rights law, but also in the national systems that either expressly or through means of interpretation, underlie to some extent the state’s duty to provide legal aid in non-criminal matters. Reference has been made to the principle of rule of law, equality and fair trial. From the viewpoint of these principles legal aid serves as the basis for individuals to avail to the law and justice and seek observance and enforcement of their rights. It has been argued that one of the justifications for the provision of civil legal aid stems from the states’ commitment to these principles. Then the chapter goes on in considering binding and non-binding documents of the United Nations, Council of European and European Union that expressly provide for a state obligation to ensure legal aid in non-criminal matters or those that bear a premise for such an obligation. Chapter three continues with an examination of the content of the state obligation to provide civil legal aid and the extent to which international human rights law requires states to provide such aid. The analysis is based on the relevant legal aid standards and criteria developed in the case-law of the relevant United Nations bodies, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. These bodies went considerable way towards securing a basic state duty to provide for a right to legal aid in non-criminal matters though, in a limited way. One should remember that international human right norms introduce minimum standards and thus, states have discretion in adopting rules concerning legal aid in non-criminal matters. The human rights rationale can serve as a starting point for any government aiming at creating or transforming an existent legal aid scheme into a modern one based on the human rights considerations. Finally, Chapter four examines the three legal aid schemes created based on the human rights considerations in Bulgaria, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. The analysis of the domestic transformations in the field of legal aid points to the direct link between the theoretical assumption of this project and the reality. The review of the three legal aid schemes affords an interesting view on the perspectives of legal aid in general and civil legal aid as by-product of the human rights rationale. This approach gave birth to a new model of legal aid schemes called “consumerist type”. The three analyzed legal aid schemes fall within the ambits of this model. In all three jurisdictions the analysis points to a number of common elements, the most important of which is the fact that it focuses on the individual that allows for an extensive approach when it comes to various elements of the scheme such as eligibility criteria, legal services covered by the scheme, legal providers, etc. Now the inherent limitations of the right to civil legal aid that stems from the old visions of charity and formal equality disappear. Of course, the achievement of the goals of any type of legal aid schemes is influenced by a number of factors, but the ideological vision behind the schemes will influence the content and the extent of the schemes and will persist and determine their overall direction. The answer given by the human rights rationale to the institution of legal aid in non-criminal matters is extensive and views civil legal aid as a self-standing right.', 'Access': 'PDF file (2130k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The transition to democratic rule that begun in the early 1990’s has not given way to the complete and categorical backsliding to autocratic rule which many countries in the continent had experienced in the mid-sixties and seventies. However, despite the staying power multiparty democracy has shown since the 1990’s in Africa, its fate has not been very rosy. The return to democracy has been hampered to a great extent by the prevalence of abuse of incumbency as well as by ethnic conflicts. In this dissertation, the author argues that there are certain structural factors in the demographic composition, political economy and history of many African countries which form a political matrix that is hostile to multi-party democracy. The prevalence of antagonistic relations and competition among ethnic groups as well as the problem of abuse of incumbency emanate from this political matrix. The main contention of this dissertation is that to respond to these problems and optimize the chances of robust and enduring democracies in Africa, there is a need for contextualizing constitutionalism. Contextualizing constitutionalism requires understanding the adverse effect of the African political matrix on multiparty democracy and designing constitutions that try to fortify constitutional democracy from the threats that emanate from these effects. Contextualization of constitutionalism is the process through which the generic concept of constitutionalism could be adapted, expanded and effectively deployed to meet the needs and specific circumstances of parts of the world which have political environments different from parts of the world where the concept of constitutionalism historically originated from. To study empirically how such contextualization might work, a comparative case study has been undertaken. The countries covered in this case study, namely Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya have all experienced the problems mentioned earlier to varying degrees. The constitutions of these countries have also been used to address these problems with different levels of success. Comparing the constitutional strategies of these four countries in dealing with abuse of incumbency and ethnicity, we can see that contextualizing constitutionalism indeed makes a difference in sustaining multiparty democracy and enhancing its quality. Specifically, clear and detailed rules prohibiting abuse of incumbency, well entrenched term limit provisions for the head of the executive, reinforcing separation of powers and checks and balances, establishing independent bodies to support constitutional democracy and enhance horizontal accountability are useful ways of minimizing abuse of incumbency. When it comes to problems related with ethnicity, using territorial decentralization, the electoral system, the form of government, affirmative action and political party regulation regimes to foster recognition of ethnic groups and national integration seem to be necessary. These instruments should be carefully calibrated in such a way that the balances will tilt towards integration without denying recognition to ethnic diversity and the need to address historical injustices. Such a careful mix of integration and accommodation is likely to avoid instability and the collapse of the democratic order. Looking beyond the countries covered in the case studies, we can observe that these approaches of dealing with abuse of incumbency and ethnicity are finding their way into constitutions that are being made in the latest constitution making wave in Africa. With increasing migration of constitutional ideas among African countries, the contextualization of constitutionalism is increasingly attaining a continental character. This character is underpinned by the need to ensure democratic governability and stability while checking hegemonic executives and stemming off ethnic conflict which is a common imperative in most sub-Saharan African countries. While the emphasis on these issues distinguishes African constitutionalism from western constitutionalism- by virtue of the fact that contextualization of constitutionalism is still an attempt to have a system of government that is democratic and liberal- there is a great deal of commonality between western and African constitutionalism.'}"

However, there are several factors that could impede the availability of credit in the society; among which is lack of adequate legal framework for secured financing. There is a direct correlation between good legal framework for security devices – personal and collateral securities - and the availability of credit in a country. Indeed without adequate laws that guarantees to the creditor repayment of the loan by the debtor, availability of credit would only be confined to the realm of academic discuss. Armed with this realization, many countries have enacted and are also periodically revising their secured transactions laws with a view to among other things: expanding access to credit by making available wide arrays of personal property as collateral for loan; ensuring that access to credit is not cut-off to consumers and SME’s in the society; providing efficient enforcement mechanisms for the realization of security in event of default as well as providing protection to debtors especially consumer debtors in the course of the credit transactions. Regrettably, many countries in Africa are yet to come to terms with the fact that availability and accessibility of credit can galvanize economic growth and consequently, are lackadaisical about reforming their outdated secured transactions laws in this regard. It is against this background that this research examines the secured transactions laws of Nigeria and Cameroon with a view to analyzing the factors that have impeded the availability and utilization of credit in both countries and making recommendations on how to overcome these factors. Although the research will consider several other factors that hinder the grant of credit - i.e., social, political and economic, this research focuses more on the inadequate legal framework for secured transactions and the imperatives of having good laws in both countries.  This focus of the research informs the choice of Article 9 of the United States Uniform Commercial Code – a developed model law on secured transactions - as the parameters for the analysis and proposals for reform of both Nigerian and Cameroon secured transactions laws. The suggested reforms, which include legal transplantation of the compatible elements of the United States secured transactions law to both countries, would serve as the basis for harmonizing both countries’ laws in this field. Besides the attendant economic benefits on trans-border commerce between the two countries that would be engendered by the harmonization, the proposed reform would bring about adequate legal framework needed to make credit available and accessible and invariably stimulate economic growth in both economies.', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2375k)'}"

In Chapter I, the thesis critically describes how the lawmaking process in international law is suppose to work, point-ing out the deficiencies of the international law master narrative in explaining the functioning of courts. In Chapter II, the thesis, using literature analysis, describes the process by which the international ad hoc criminal tribunals have expanded and shaped international humanitarian and international criminal law. It claims that the ad hoc tribunals have imported a consider-able number of definitions of crimes from its sister branch, international human rights law, but national criminal law as well, and then modified them to suit the specific international criminal environment and the international system more broadly. Chapter III, asks the intermediate question of acceptances of the normative outcomes of the ad hoc tribunals by other actors, namely scholars and other international (criminal) courts. It concludes that, for the most part, the outcomes of the ad hoc tribunals have been accepted by the wider scholarly community and other international courts. However, courts, other than the other international/ized criminal courts, see the outcomes of the ad hoc tribu-nals as something stemming from a foreign normative sphere, something that they cannot ar-gue with but only accept. Chapter IV tackles the issue of the background of doctrine of sources master narrative and its compatibility with the way in which international courts argue and structure their judgments and argues that the legitimizing method that international tribunals have adopted is the one that fits better with the structural environment of the international system.', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1464k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements Adobe Acrobat Reader; Postrcript compatible printer'}"

The main purpose is to evaluate the extent to which the laws of these two jurisdictions can be seen as being in line with the economic theory of exclusive territories. To this end, the paper first lays down what it considers as the most appropriate approach for judging the legality of exclusive territories, identifying a rule of reason as the optimal rule. Compared to this rule, the current U.S. approach, bordering with per se legality, is qualified as inappropriate. On the other hand, the paper praises the EU’s approach towards non-airtight exclusive distribution agreements, characterizing it as a structured rule of reason. Conversely, the paper criticizes the EU’s tough stance towards airtight exclusive distribution agreements, which borders with per se illegality. The paper also addresses some enforcement aspects with regards to exclusive distribution agreements. As for the U.S., the emphasis is on the way in which ideology and the existence of treble damages have contributed to the current state of the law of exclusive territories. Regarding the EU, the essential role of the Commission and its views is stressed. Further, the paper argues that, if not followed by a reconsideration of the fining policy, the trend towards facilitating private damages actions in the EU can lead to an inadequate outcome connected to the EU’s approach to exclusive territories. Finally, the paper addresses the relationship between exclusive distribution agreements and arbitration. In this respect the paper finds that antitrust issues arising out of an exclusive distribution agreement can be referred to arbitration both in the U.S. and the EU; that the court review of awards dealing with antitrust issues is potentially stricter in the EU than in the U.S., in parallel with the approach that the two jurisdiction have towards the legality of exclusive territories; finally, the law of exclusive territories should be considered as mandatory law in both of the analyzed jurisdictions, with pertinent implications for the arbitral proceedings.', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1535k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Relying on a tradition which claims that law is a tool of social control and regulation I describe the rise of legal institutions as mechanisms to solve the problems of uncertainty. Institutions, built as they are against particular social background of values, customs, religion and informal rules, are charged with making binary decisions on what is legal or illegal. In so doing, legal institutions are influenced by social norms which have a psychological impact on legal decision makers (legislators, jurors and judges). In turn, institutions and legal decisions influence social norms themselves. The work takes as its starting point a sociological claim that legal systems for regulating religious groups judge all non-mainstream religious groups by assessing them according to their relative status, in a Weberian sense of the word, in the social strata of a given society. I extend this thesis by claiming that the status of a given religious group depends on its social distance from what is socially constructed as the mainstream and a potential for disloyalty to the state-backed mainstream norms expressed trough law. The main claim of this work is that legal judgment of non-mainstream religious groups is based on judgment of the three major functions of religious groups posited in the theory of religious groups developed. It is assumed, hence, that the legal judgment of “disloyalty” potential and social distance (that is, ‘status judgment’) is the perception of boundary sustaining, group cooperation and credibility-enhancing mechanisms, which serve as proxies for assessing the (un)acceptability of emotions, beliefs and identities that precede them, when compared against the reference point of law backed mainstream norms. Analytically, judgments of social distance and disloyalty are in practice intertwined, but can be distinguished, since the judgment of ‘disloyalty’ is normatively stronger, and usually has more immediate practical implications depending on whether the disloyalty is considered to be of such level that it creates (or is perceived as creating) present or future social harm and danger. It is expected that the judgment of disloyalty of a non-mainstream religious group is directly proportional to its non-recognition and a punitive treatment within the legal and social system. Social distance, on the other hand, is relatively frequent in cases involving new or non-mainstream religious groups, given their ‘deviance from normalcy’. The judgment of ‘social distance’ itself, however, need not imply denials of legal status and rights, especially in cases of small, socially secluded religious groups given they are able to fully internalize the costs of their functions, without imposing any costs on the rest of the society; or in cases of non-mainstream religious groups who have moved, on some scale, closer to mainstream. In other words, the further a group is from what is legally perceived as mainstream on the scale of social distance and the more secluded it is without creating perceived social harm and being judged as disloyal, the more likely it is to succeed with its legal claim. Non-mainstream religious groups that move into the mid-range of social distance receive mixed treatment, depending on whether the legal claims they make encroach on ‘mainstream values’ (in which case they fail); or whether their claim is ‘internalized’, that is it concern predominantly the group itself (in which case they are more likely to succeed.) The theory developed is than applied to three cases, the US, Germany and France. In these three chapters, a historical – institutional analysis of the development of the legal treatment of non-mainstream religions is undertaken in order to explain historical developments using concepts developed in chapter One. In Chapter Two, which deals with the case of non-mainstream religions in the US, the argument I advance is that the American society and law have gone through a slow process of an increase of social and legal toleration of non-mainstream religious groups – from fighting Mormons in 19th century towards legal and to a certain extent also social approval of a religiously inspired behavior of socially distant smaller and secluded religious communities (the toleration of petty claims). Chapter Three is devoted to the analysis of the German “cooperationist” system of regulating religious groups, and the argument advanced there is that the demand for non-mainstream group loyalty is one of the cornerstones behind legal regulatory system. The mainstream norms behind the legal system have not yet produced any strongly felt need to develop mechanisms for strategic change. There were no reasons yet, external or internal, to engage in games of strategic shifts and “acceptance” in a way I elaborated in the chapter on US. In fact, things are likely opposite and can be well combined with the loyalty-Christian culture-protectionism demands posed by the German mainstream. To the extent that homogeneity is or will be reduced in future, it should be rather clear that temptations to play strategic shifts and “acceptance” game will be stronger, while the loyalist-Christine culture-protectionism arguments will gain even more stronghold in order to set boundaries firmly. The analysis of French laicite and treatment of non-mainstream religions in France is undertaken in Chapter Four. The analysis shows that one of the potent forces behind the treatment of non-mainstream religious groups in France is an attempt to forge social unity and resolve the problem of 'groups within groups' or 'nations within nation,' an idea which has been ingrained in the project of the French Republicanism, secularism and anticlericalism from the beggining."", 'Local note': 'PDF file (2644k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The thesis in so doing undertakes a comparative analysis, covering the jurisdictions of US and EU and Kenya, South Africa and India. The interaction between patent rights and competition policy may give rise to anti-competitive effects where patent rights are exercised abusively, in a manner detrimental to fair trade and competition. In developing countries, the interaction is complex and multifaceted and may give rise to anti-competitive effects which have human rights, economic, cultural and social implications. This has been illustrated in South Africa following the HIV/AIDS crisis in 1998 where proceedings were instituted against pharmaceutical manufacturing companies on grounds that they were engaging in anti-competitive practices and abusing their patent rights resulting in high prices of necessary drugs. Other fields of interest analysed in this thesis include plant patents and plant variety righgs, biotechnology patents, traditional knowledge and transfer of technology. This interface between patent rights and competition policy can be seen in two instances, the first being in the determination, analysis and interpretation of the substantive standards of patentability. The non-compliance with patentability standards may result in a patent grant that affects competition from other innovators by presenting a barrier for further innovations and placing the patent owner in a dominant position. The second interaction is evident where the terms and conditions of a patent licensing agreement are exclusionary such that they block out competition, and present a barrier for technology transfer. The TRIPS Agreement recognises that intellectual property rights are susceptible to abuse, which may have adverse effects on trade and present a barrier to transfer and dissemination of technology to developing countries. Taking this into consideration developing countries are presented with the need to find a solution to combat adverse effects arising out of abuse of intellectual property rights.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1917k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Hence the international justice becomes a full-fledged international regime: a system of knowledge, norms, principles and expertise, entailing an individualistic and legalistic perspective on the human rights atrocities. Alternative to the prevailing liberal explanations of the current proliferation of the international justice regimes, this work suggests a realist, or power based explanation that refers to the political tensions unformulated and ‘repressed’ in the international justice regime’s operation. The methodology includes discourse analysis, structural study of international legal argumentation and the international relations and international law approach. Two case studies that demonstrate this hypothesis are the Congo v. Belgium decision of the ICJ and the Rome Statute of the ICC. It is concluded that the heterogeneity of individual centered assumptions of international justice regimes to the residual state responsibility and other state-centered regimes of international law cannot be resolved through the indeterminate international legal structures, and creates a haven for power maximization tactics of actors. The attentiveness to state presence and clashes of sovereign powers involved in trials for human rights atrocities can square the international justice regimes with the residual international regimes of state responsibility, diplomatic intercourse, or international peace and security.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1140k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

While it is crucial to configure the hyper-parameters properly, the most widely used grid search technique has some hidden issues that impacts the efficiency of the learning algorithm. Such an issue is that the mentioned method does not take statistical significance of out-of-sample forecasting performance into consideration when choosing the hyper-parameter yielding the minimal loss. The following paper proposes an extension of this approach to make the modeling more robust to random fluctuation. The Model Confidence Set algorithm terminates at a superior set of hyper-parameters that are statistically indistinguishable at a given a significance level with respect to the loss their generated models produce. It is shown empirically and theoretically, that averaging over the predictions of such a superior set is more efficient with respect to out-of-sample loss than taking the prediction of a single realization of the ”minimum-yielding” hyper-parameter. The theoretical argument is based on showing a specific example, where the limitations of the grid search method are reached. The empirical study examines the predictability of the evolution of the novel Covid-19 infectious disease in New York state, U.S.A.

The total human population is compartmentalised into four classes, namely, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected and the recovered class. The total mosquito population is classified into three sub classes, e.g., the susceptible, the exposed and the infected class. A region is found out where the model is epidemiologically feasible and mathematically well-posed. The existence of equilibrium along with its stability is derived. The stability criteria do depend on the reproduction number which is calculated by the next-generation matrix technique. For a quantitative insight of the model, a thorough large-scale numerical simulation has been performed and the predicted results are presented graphically. The sequential and Strang-Marchuk splitting schemes together with RK4 numerical method have been leveraged to get the splitting solution of the matrix differential equation. However, the reference solution of the unsplit system is obtained by solving the system of ODEs by the RK4 method. Since the exact solution of the unsplit system considered is not known, this numerical solution is compared with the numerical solution obtained by using the explicit Euler method. The order and accuracy of the methods have been derived both analytically and numerically, and we have also calculated the numerical error (local/global practical error) associated with the methods.

Any sheaf of abelian groups over a topological space X can be considered as an algebraic object as it is a collection of abelian groups, parametrized by the space X. It also can be considered as a topological object by lifting the topology of X under the natural projection given by the parameters of the collection. From this, we apply homological algebra to construct sheaf cohomology, which helps us to investigate the global sections of sheaves. For computation of sheaf cohomology, we describe two methods. The first one is based on fine resolutions, which is useful in case of paracompact Hausdorff spaces. The second one uses ÄŒech cohomology, which is very useful when we have natural open coverings of the space X. As an application, we investigate the notion of Stein varieties in terms of sheaf cohomology.

Our motivation comes from a work of Liu, Dehmamy, and Barabasi, where the authors study the “tangledness” of graph embeddings. In order to test their hypothesis, they need to generate random embeddings of a given graph into R3 with many “self-linkings”. Once the image of each vertex is fixed, they replace each edge with a polygonal path (broken line) whose intermediate points are IID points chosen from a uniform distribution. Then they measure the tangledness of the embedding by considering the linking numbers of pairs of disjoint cycles of the graph. They make several empirical observations for these random embeddings. Our original goal was to study the distribution of the linking number of two random polygonal paths. Computer simulations suggested that, after proper normalization, it might converge to a normal distribution (as the number of IID intermediate points go to infinity). We started our investigations with a less complicated problem of similar flavor: the winding nuber of a random (closed) polygonal path on the plane. After expressing the winding number as the sum of a martingale difference sequence, we could rigorously prove that its distribution converges to a Gaussian by applying a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for martingales. Then we turned to the linking number hoping to be able to prove a CLT for its distribution using similar tools. Now we believe that the limiting distribution is not quite normal. We do not have a rigorous proof at this point but our observations suggest that we may see an uncountable mixture of centered Gaussians in the limit.', 'Note': 'Degree: MSc', 'File Type': 'PDF file (739k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

We also give sharp results on the number of edges that $D$ may have to guarantee that $K_{n,n}$ is terminal-pairable with respect to $D$. This generalizes the work of Gy\\H{o}ri, Mezei and Mészáros on complete base graphs. In our proofs, edge colorings of multigraphs are used and we apply the celebrated result of Kahn on the list chromatic index of multigraphs along with other more classical result on edge colorings.   In the second chapter, the well-studied problem of $L(2,1)$-labelings of graphs, a vertex color where the colors satisfy some distance restrictions, is studied. We focus on oriented graphs, and prove an analogous result of Griggs and Yeh in this setting about bounds on the $L(2,1)$ number in terms of the maximum degree of the graph and related parameters. We introduce alternative versions of the $L(2,1)$-labeling problem and prove similar results for these new problems raised. Finally, we improve some results of Jiang, Shao and Vesel on the $L(2,1)$ number of product of oriented cycles.   In the third chapter, we consider the problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Rothschild of determining the maximum number of edge colorings without a monochromatic copy of a fixed subgraph that a graph on $n$ vertices may admit.

In Chapter 2 we introduce the central concept of our thesis. For a sequence of functions $f_n : \\{-1,1\\}^{V_n} \\longrightarrow \\R$ defined on increasing configuration spaces we talk about sparse reconstruction if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \\subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $ _n| = o( _n|)$ such that knowing the coordinates in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.  We first show that if the underlying measure is a product measure, then for transitive functions no sparse reconstruction is possible. We discuss the question in different ways, measuring information content in $L^2$ and with entropy. We also highlight some interesting connections with cooperative game theory. Furthermore, we show that the left-right crossing event for critical planar percolation on the square lattice does not admit sparse reconstruction either. These results answer questions posed by I. Benjamini.  Chapter 3 extends the question of sparse reconstruction to some larger classes of sequences of measures. We find that if the average correlation of spins in a sequence of spin systems decays slower than $1/ _n|$, then sparse reconstruction is possible. We also investigate the question for sequences converging to a finitary factor of IID system and we find that the expected coding volume plays a crucial role in determining whether there is sparse reconstruction or not.  Finally, we apply our results and methods to investigate Ising models on sequences of locally convergent graphs. We show that there is sparse reconstruction for low temperature and critical Ising models, and that there is no sparse reconstruction on the high temperature Curie-Weiss model.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The study of the topology and descriptive set theory of these spaces is an active area of research today, with close connections to many other areas of set theory and to model theory. In this thesis we investigate, for generalized Baire spaces, the uncountable analogues of perfect set theorems and classical dichotomy theorems concerning colorings (or equivalently, graphs and hypergraphs) on the lowest levels of the Borel hierarchy. For example, we show that the kappa-analogue of the perfect set version of the Open Coloring Axiom, restricted to kappa-analytic subsets of the kappa-Baire space, is consistent relative to (and therefore equiconsistent with) the existence of an inaccessible cardinal above kappa. We also consider dichotomies for colorings on the second level of the kappa-Borel hierarchy. We prove the analogue of the previous result in the case of the kappa-Silver dichotomy for $\\Sigma^0_2$ equivalence relations. We obtain perfect set theorems for homogeneous sets with respect to families of kappa many $\\Pi^0_2$ colorings, some of which are strengthenings of an earlier joint result of Jouko Väänänen and the author. We also discuss different possible generalizations of the concept of perfectness for the kappa-Baire space. While these definitions of perfectness are equivalent in classical descriptive set theory, they lead to different notions in the uncountable setting. We study in detail the connections between these concepts and the games underlying (some of) their definitions. We obtain equivalent characterizations of several dichotomies studied in this thesis in terms of these perfect set games and their natural analogues for open colorings. We also consider generalizations of density for the kappa-Baire space which correspond to the different notions of perfectness, and look at a ""dense in itself subset property"" for the kappa-Baire space. The approximations (in the sense of [Hyttinen1990]) of the games discussed here can be used to generalize Cantor-Bendixson ranks for subsets of the kappa-Baire space [Väänänen1991] and for subtrees of $\\kappa^{<\\kappa}$, as well as different analogues of these ranks for open colorings.

Since overtwisted structures respect homotopy principles, we restrict the question to tight structures, and among them to the fillable ones, which bound in symplectic or holomorphic category. First to be understood are prime atoroidal manifolds, which are either hyperbolic or small Seifert fibered. This thesis deals with small Seifert fibered manifolds, which are obtained from circle bundles over the sphere by performing Dehn surgery along (at most) three of its fibers. For many of these manifolds, the complete classification is known, and all tight structures are also fillable. We review these results from various perspectives: convex decompositions along with contact surgery, the dual presentation by open books, and in Heegaard Floer theory by means of the Ozsváth-Szabó contact invariant. Our main focus are zero-twisting structures on small Seifert fibered spaces of the form M(-1;r_1,r_2,r_3), which are special as they include non-fillable tight structures. We classify them by the Ozsváth-Szabó contact invariant and characterize which of them are (Stein) fillable. The crucial properties of these contact manifolds are the possibility to view the underlying manifold as the boundary of a negative definite plumbing and the planarity of the contact structures. For classification of tight structures, we use a specific description of Heegaard Floer homology by equivalence classes of characteristic cohomology elements on the bounded plumbing; we single out the elements which correspond to the contact invariants and give a contact interpretation to the equivalence relations between them. In order to characterize fillability, we study positive factorizations of the planar monodromy.', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Our first result is a link version of the Thurston-Bennequin inequality. This inequality, in its usual formulation, gives an upper bound for the maximal Thurston-Bennequin and self-linking numbers of a knot $K$ in a tight contact 3-manifolds $(M,\\xi)$, in terms of the Euler characteristic of a Seifert surface for $K$. We generalize the inequality to every link $L$, where the resulting upper bound involves the Thurston norm of $L$. This is a rational number extracted from the semi-norm, introduced by Thurston, on the relative second homology group of a 3-manifold with toric boundary.  We say that two $n$-component links in $S^3$ are strongly concordant if there is a cobordism between them consisting of $n$ disjoint annuli, each one realizing a knot concordance. Then, starting from a grid diagram $D$ of a link $L$, we define a filtered chain complex $\\left(\\widehat{GC}(D),\\widehat\\partial\\right)$ and we prove that its homology, denoted with $\\widehat{\\mathcal{HFL}}(L)$, is a strong concordance invariant.  Since we can prove that $\\widehat{\\mathcal{HFL}}(L)$ has dimension one in Maslov grading zero, we also extract a numerical invariant from the homology group that we call $\\tau(L)$. The $\\tau$-invariant gives a lower bound for the slice genus $g_4(L)$, which is the minimum genus of an oriented, compact surface properly embedded in $D^4$ and whose boundary is $L$. We also show that there is a strict relation between the filtration levels of $\\widehat{\\mathcal{HFL}}(L)$ and the Alexander grading of the torsion-free quotient of $cHFL^-(L)$, a different bigraded version of link Floer homology.  Furthermore, we define an invariant of Legendrian links by using open book decompositions. This is done by describing a suitable condition for an open book decomposition $(B,\\pi,A)$ to be adapted to a Legendrian link $L$, where $A$ is a system of generators of the first relative homology group of $\\overline{\\pi^{-1}(1)}$. At this point, we define a special Heegaard diagram $D$ for the link $L$ in the 3-manifold $-M$, given by reversing the orientation on $M$; we have that $D$ is obtained up to isotopy from $(B,\\pi,A)$ and then, when $L$ is zero in homology, the invariant $\\mathfrak L(L,M,\\xi)$ is the isomorphism class of a distinguished cycle $\\mathfrak L(D)$ in the link Floer complex $cCFL^-(D,\\mathfrak t_{\\xi})$.  We also give some results on quasi-positive links in $S^3$. In particular, we introduce the subfamily of connected transverse $\\C$-links: these are links such that the surface $\\Sigma_B$, associated to a quasi-positive braid $B$ for $L$, is connected. We show that, for this kind of links, the slice genus $g_4$ is determined by $\\tau$. This allows us to prove that the slice genus is additive under connected sums of connected transverse $\\C$-links.', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The common theme of building limiting theories has been present in probability theory, extremal graph theory and group theory, just to name the areas closest to the scope of this thesis.The shared philosophy of all these areas is that the limiting language creates a connection between the combinatorial nature of the finite structures and the analytic properties of the limiting objects. In many cases the tools available for the finite and infinite worlds reinforce each other and lead to surprising results, new notions and interesting questions. In this thesis we exhibit examples of this approach in the field of measured group theory, where the main objects of interest are probability measure preserving (p.m.p.) actions of groups. These arise naturally as limiting objects in the sparse graph limit theory.  First we investigate invariant random subgroups (IRS's) in groups acting on rooted trees. We prove that a nontrivial ergodic IRS of the group of alternating finitary automorphisms that acts without fixed points on the boundary of the tree contains a level stabilizer. In particular it is the random conjugate of a finite index subgroup. We generalize this to certain branch groups, and also to the case when fixed points are allowed.  We then procede to show a connection between the notions of cost (by Gaboriau) and combinatorial cost (by Elek), and as an application prove new results for the rank gradient of finitely generated groups. In the last chapter we investigate the distortion function of p.m.p. actions. This invariant was recently introduced by Abért, Gelander and Nikolov to measure the necessary complexity of generation when getting close to the cost.

In Chapter 2 we study the SI spreading with transmission times following power-law distribution with in finite expectation.

In particular, we will be concerned with the function La(n, P ), defined to be the maximum number of sets we can take in the Boolean lattice 2[n] without intro- ducing the relations of a poset P as containment relations among the sets. This function plays an analogous role in the setting of nonuniform hypergraphs (set systems) as the extremal function ex(n, G) in graph theory and has already been studied extensively. While this type of problem was formally introduced in 1983, there have already been more than 50 papers on the subject. The majority of the results involve bounding La(n,P) both in a general sense, as well as for numerous specific cases of posets. The thesis is divided into 5 main chapters. The first chapter gives a summary of the history of forbidden poset problems as well as the relevant background information from extremal set theory. In the second chapter we give a significant improvement of the general bounds on La(n,P) as a function of the height of the poset h(P) and the size of the poset  | due to Burcsi and Nagy and later Chen and Li. The resulting bound is in a certain sense best possible. We also give an improvement of the bound on the so-called Lubell function in the induced version of the problem, and we introduce a new chain counting technique which may have additional applications. The results in this chapter were joint work with D ániel Gr ósz and Abishek Methuku. The third chapter introduces a new partitioning technique on cyclic permutations. In this chapter we find a surprising generalization of a result of De Bonis, Katona and Swanepoel on a poset known as the butterfly. Namely, we show that one can introduce a subdivision to one of the edges of the Hasse diagram of this poset and prove that nonetheless the same bound holds on its extremal number. Using the new partitioning technique we also determine the exact bound for the La function of an infinite class of pairs of posets. The results in this chapter were joint work with Abhishek Methuku. In the fourth chapter we introduce a new variation on the extremal subposet problem. Namely, we assume that the family must also be intersecting. We give a novel generalization of the partition method of Griggs and Li and prove an exact bound for intersecting, butterfly-free families. We also give a new proof of a result of Gerbner on intersecting k-Sperner families and determine the equality cases for the first time. The results in this chapter were joint work with D ániel Gerbner and Abhishek Methuku.

For example, a germ of a normal space is regular if (and only if) its link is the three sphere S^3 (it is even sufficient to assume that π_1(M) = 1 ). The geometric genus, p_g, is an analytic invariant of (X, 0) which, in general, cannot be recovered from the link. However, whether p_g = 0 can be determined from the link. The same holds for the statement p_g = 1, assuming that (X, 0) is Gorenstein. It is an interesting question to ask, whether, under suitable analytic and topological conditions, the geometric genus (or other analytic invariants) can be recovered from the link. The Casson invariant conjecture predicts that p_g can be identified using the Casson invariant in the case when (X, 0) is a complete intersection and M has trivial first homology with integral coefficients (the original statement identifies the signature of a Milnor fiber rather then p_g, but in this case, these are equivalent data). The Seiberg--Witten invariant conjecture predicts that the geometric genus of a Gorenstein singularity, whose link has trivial first homology with rational coefficients, can be calculated as a normalized Seiberg--Witten invariant of the link. The first conjecture is still open, but counterexamples have been found for the second one. We prove here the Seiberg--Witten invariant conjecture for hypersurface singularities given by a function with Newton nondegenerate principal part. We provide a theory of computation sequences and how they bound the geometric genus. Newton nondegenerate singularities can be resolved explicitly by Oka's algorithm, and we exploit the combinatorial interplay between the resolution graph and the Newton diagram to show that in each step of the computation sequence constructed, the given bound is sharp. Our method recovers the geometric genus of (X, 0) explicitly from the link, assuming that (X, 0) is indeed Newton nondegenerate with a rational homology sphere link. With some additional information about the Newton diagram, we recover part of the spectrum, as well as the Poincaré series associated with the Newton filtration. Finally, we show that the normalized Seiberg--Witten invariant associated with the canonical spin^c structure on the link coincides with our identification of the geometric genus."", 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The lattice cohomology is an important tool in the study of topological properties of a plumbed 3-manifold M associated with a connected negative definite plumbing graph G. It connects the topological properties with analytic ones when M is realized as a singularity link, i.e. when G is a good resolution graph of the singularity. Its computation is based on the (Riemann-Roch) weights of the lattice points of Z^s, where s is the number of vertices of G.  The first part of the thesis reduces the rank of this lattice to the number of `bad' vertices of the graph. Usually, the geometry/topology of M is encoded exactly by these `bad' vertices and their number measures how far the plumbing graph stays from a rational one.  In the second part, we identify the following three objects: the Seiberg-Witten invariant of a plumbed 3-manifold, the periodic constant of its topological Poincare series, and a coefficient of an equivariant multivariable Ehrhart polynomial. For this, we construct the corresponding polytope from the plumbing graph, together with an action of H_1(M,Z), and we develop Ehrhart theory for them. Moreover, we generalize the concept of the periodic constant for multivariable series and establish its corresponding properties.  The effect of the reduction appears also at the level of the multivariable topological Poincare series, simplifying the corresponding polytope and the Ehrhart theory as well.

The main focus of interest is a special type of real quadratic fields with Richaud–Degert discriminants d = (an)^2 +4a, which class number problem is similar to the one for imaginary quadratic fields.  The thesis contains the solution of the class number one problem for the two-parameter family of real quadratic fields with square-free discriminant d = (an)^2 +4a for positive odd integers a and n, where n is divisible by 43.181.353. More precisely, it is shown that there are no such fields with class number one. This is the first unconditional result on class number problem for Richaud–Degert discriminants depending on two parameters, extending a vast literature on one-parameter cases. The applied method follows results of A. Biró for computing a special value of a certain zeta function for the real quadratic field, but uses also new ideas relating our problem to the class number of some imaginary quadratic fields.  Further, the existence of infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields whose discriminant has exactly three distinct prime factors and whose class group has an element of a fixed large order is proven. The main tool used is solving an additive problem via the circle method. This result on divisibility of class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields is applied to generalize the first theorem: there is an infinite family of parameters q = p_1p_2p_3, where p_1, p_2, p_3 are distinct primes, and q=3(mod 4), with the following property. If d = (an)^2 + 4a is square-free for odd positive integers a and n, and q divides n, then the class number of quadratic fields with this discriminant is greater than one.  The third main result is establishing an effective lower bound for the class number of the family of real quadratic fields Q(\\sqrt{d}), where d = n^2 + 4 is a square-free positive integer with n = m(m^2  306) for some odd m, with some extra condition on d. This result can be regarded as a corollary of a theorem of Goldfeld and some calculations involving elliptic curves and local heights. The lower bound tending to infinity for a subfamily of the real quadratic fields with discriminant d = n^2+4 could be interesting having in mind that even the class number two problem for these discriminants is still an open problem.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (875k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Given the number of columns and the family of minimal keys an interesting task is to find the minimal number of rows with which a matrix can be constructed that fulfills these requirements. Secret sharing is based on a similar situation. There is a treasure box with many keyholes with each participant holding a key. The box can only be opened if at least a given number of key holders pool their resources together. This can also be formulated by a matrix where the participants are represented by the columns and the treasures are the indices of the rows. Here one can also ask what the minimum number of rows is with which this situation can be reached. In both problems insufficient resources should not determine the row/secret. However, in real life applications we need stronger security. We cannot allow the possibilities to be narrowed down to the point where brute force is enough to find the correct one. Also we may require that the keys of the participants must be changed from time to time, in other words there must be many sets of partial secrets which properly function.

Using functional analytic tools and methods from ergodic the- ory, we describe various features of (almost) weakly stable semigroups. In particular, we show that (in the Baire category sense) typical elements in certain natural spaces of semi- groups are almost weakly but not weakly stable, thus we carry over classical theorems of Halmos and Rohlin for measure preserving transformations to the Hilbert space operator setting. Further, we illustrate operator semigroup methods and results on a class of telegraph systems with various boundary conditions. We study both linear and nonlinear boundary value problems. The stability of linear telegraph systems is discussed by applying theorems from the previous chapters. For the existence of solutions, we are particularly interested in time-dependent boundary conditions, since this case has little been investigated so far. The operator semigroup techniques applied to the case of Lipschitz continuous non- linearities are combined with estimates from the theory of monotone operators to yield well-posedness and the regularity of the solutions, also in the case of dynamic boundary conditions.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (550k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

I argue that cathedral ambulatories could and did fulfill multiple roles. In the case of Kraków and Prague, the two most important centers, royal prestige, honoring the patron saint, liturgical considerations and creating a place for high-profile burials were all reasons that probably contributed to the choice. In all the cathedrals, ambulatories provided an ideal solution for wealthy patrons and bishops who wished to be buried close to the main altar.

How did the cult arrive? Who were the promoters? What were the main features of the cult? The first two chapters provide the historical circumstances of the formation of virgin martyrs’ cult and the emergence of Saint Dorothy’s cult in Europe. Saint Dorothy was a young virgin, who during the reign of Emperor Diocletian suffered martyrdom in Cappadocia in the Late Antiquity. Legends were produced about her life from the early Middle Ages, however, only from the mid-fourteenth century did she become popular in various European regions, including Italy and Germany. She was particularly popular in German-speaking territories. The third chapter presents the arrival of Saint Dorothy’s cult in Hungary and shows that she was unknown in the Árpádian period. It seems that the cult emerged during the Angevin era. Her veneration became widespread only from the 1360s. Probably Dorothy’s cult connected to clerics from Poland, who arrived in the entourage of Queen Elizabeth Piast, wife of Charles I. Other traces suggest German origin, since her cult was mostly popular in the German-speaking territories of Hungary. The two origins do not exclude each other, because the Polish towns were also frequently populated by Germans. Dorothy’s veneration centered in Szepesség in Hungary, where an extensive fresco cycle commemorates her suffering. The fifteenth and sixteenth-century textual and pictorial representations emphasize the importance of Dorothy’s intercessory power. Besides her imago, the most frequent depiction was her rose miracle. On late medieval altarpieces she accompanied Virgin Mary with other virgins, which refers to her status as sponsa Christi and to her intimate relationship with the mother of Christ. Interestingly, hospitals were also dedicated to Saint Dorothy (usually she was a co-patron), which might have derived from the fact that she promised that she would help to rescue people from poverty.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (3050k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

Taming depicts the widespread practice of land enclosure, and offers this practice of privatizing land as a catalyst for violence against women in the enclosure of the private domestic space. Measure depicts a woman’s virginity as being one possible culprit that subjects her to violence. This idea is explained by looking at both the hymen and the convent as enclosures for women. Moreover, the play juxtaposes brothels with convents, brothel mistresses with nuns, in order to showcase how these two institutions (and the women therein), posed a threat to a male oriented society, since they were female dominated spheres, not subject to external male authority. Merchant rethinks the concept of skin as an enclosure, and assesses the ways in which dark complexioned (African) women were dehumanized and marginalized in Elizabethan-Stuart England. Conceptual metaphor theory will be used in order to assess the nature of enclosure within the context of each work. This theory rests on the idea that metaphors begin as literal, decontextualized terms, and individuals may then supply personal understanding and meanings to these terms. Finally, the metaphor is born when these decontextualized and individual definitions are fully merged and generally understood by society at large. And so the metaphor of ‘enclosure’ is effectively employed by Shakespeare to showcase his understanding of identity and gender in early modern England, a society reaffirming its own identity in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (896k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

My main goal is to examine the Annales’s entries about the reign of Henry III, because these parts contain an unusually large quantity of the so-called “unique” entries, which can only be found in the Annales. However, to prove the veracity of these “unique” entries about Henry III—that is, whether they were fictitious accounts inserted by Aventinus or taken from a lost source—certain examinations are necessary in my thesis. At first, I summarize the life of the Bavarian historiographer in order to understand his historiographical practice, personal viewpoints, and therefore, to evaluate of Aventinus as a historian. After that, I present the historiographical practice of Aventinus’s historical writing and his historiographical principles, which can be detected in his texts. I demonstrate that there are three discernible historiographical principles which appear in Aventinus’s Annales: his patriotism, his love for rhetorical devices, and his disapproval towards the Catholic Church. It was precisely these principles, which occasionally made Aventinus alter the content of his sources. Following this chapter, I identify the sources of the Annales regarding the reign-period of Henry III, and finally, I dealt with the so-called “unique” entries of Aventinus.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1104k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The thesis examines to what extend Italian early humanism and Cola di Rienzo in particular could affect Milicius. To find out whether Milicius could be regarded as a ‘proto-humanist’, I will focus my thesis on three questions: why was there Bohemian ‘proto- humanism’ at the Charles IV’s court? What was Cola di Rienzo’s impact on Milicius’ apocalyptic vision? What were the key features of Milicius’ preaching activity and to what extent did they fit the concept of ‘Bohemian proto-humanism’? By answering these questions, I aim to examine Milicius not as a reformist and Hus’ precursor, but as a stand-alone intellectual and provide a better understanding how texts and ideas migrated to Bohemia. I will argue in this thesis that we may perceive Milicius as an intellectual which was at least partly influenced by the notion of the Bohemian ‘proto-humanism’, since he was surrounded by ‘proto- humanists’ at the royal court, was familiar with works of Cola di Rienzo, referred to antique literature in his sermons, criticized the clergy and promoted the vernacular language. However, although Cola’s effect on Milicius is unquestionable, similar apocalyptic visions and programs of the Church’s reformation were expressed long before Milicius, therefore, we can rather contemplate on his figure through the lenses of medieval continuity.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1135k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The texts on the plate consist of a verse inscription in Latin and two name labels (Innocentius, Pelso) while the images represent various scenes of the daily life of a villa estate. The plate was probably found in Hungary in the 1970s as a part of a larger hoard. The introduction presents the topic in its modern context (the modern-day history of the object), since without the understanding the issues of its provenance it cannot be understood why it is much safer (in terms of archaeological research) to deal with plate alone and not with the treasure in general. From the data currently available, we can distinguish at least four key phases or social contexts in which the Seuso Hunting Plate participated. These are the contexts of the patron, the maker, the owner, and the viewer. Although it is impossible to identify the exact patron of the object examined, the textual and visual sources are sufficient to provide at least a profile of the probable patron of the Seuso Hunting Plate, the person who commissioned the object, using two traditional methods: epigraphy and iconological analysis. This Late Roman silver plate conveys the patron’s messages, which are incorporated into the object through conscious and unconscious choices. My thesis aims to unpack these messages by using different strategies of examination. After the analysis the texts (chapter 1) I contextualize the imagery (chapter 2) of the plate: the outdoor banquet, the hunting scenes, and the rural landscape. My starting point is that the composition of the plate is abstract and referential rather than illustrative, so the focus falls on the images and the meanings represented by them, which convey certain symbolic values. The analysis of the visual language of the plate shows that the iconography is not an ad-hoc depiction of a real picnic, hunt and villa estate but a carefully constructed iconography referring to good life and a locus amoenus, and they fit very closely into the domestic décor of the age. I aimed to demonstrate the importance of looking closely at objects and the potential of an integrated and contextual approach in the study of Late Roman silver and art in general, since the relationship between visual representations and written sources are highly complex and one should not choose to analyse only one of them since both are fundamental in research, especially if we do not have the archaeological context in which the object was found.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (4708k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The reign of the Stjepan Tomaš was essentially the time of the Franciscan triumph over the heretical Bosnian Church, the traditional spiritual pillar of political power in Bosnia. The spheres of life that these two organizations were competing to dominate were fully taken over by the friars and after a phase of gradual decline, the king ultimately expelled the Bosnian Church. The papacy also included Bosnia in an anti-Ottoman front, giving the friars the floor to present their ruler as an exemplary Christian and to preach the crusade. At the same time, the expansion of the Observant movement contributed to partition of the large Bosnian vicary among the local, Apulian, Dalmatian and Hungarian Observant communities. The conflict between them and their Observant superiors went on during the entire reign of Tomaš and brought together the monarchy and the vicary.

From a theoretical perspective, it tries to go beyond the supposed dichotomy between heresy and orthodoxy that informs many studies of Islamic history. It argues that in the sixteenth-century Damascus, Cairo, Aleppo, and Istanbul heresy was not a universal term, but a context-bound one. In many studies, heresy is the synonym for heterodoxy and heretical ideas are generally understood as ideas that do not suit the sharia and sunna. The problem with this dichotomy is that scholars approach it as timeless and universal. However, as I show in this thesis, the controversial Sufi shaykh Ibn Arabi (d. 1240) was accepted as a true saint in the Ottoman realm while his veracity was highly debated in the Mamluk lands. Furthermore, even in the Mamluk lands, being an Ibn Arabi supporter was seen as appropriate at certain points in time, but in a later period it could be the grounds for the execution. In this thesis, I have attempted to contextualize two polemical, anti-Ibn Arabi works by Ibrahim al-Halabi (d. 1549), Nimat al-Dharia fi Nusrat al-Sharia and Tasfih al-Ghabi fi Tanzih Ibn Arabi, in the changing social, political and religious dynamics of the early modern Islamic eastern Mediterranean. Examining the debate about Ibn Arabi in the sixteenth- century Ottoman state, I have argued that Ibrahim al-Halabi had a great influence on the new, more critical stance of the Ottoman ulema vis-à-vis Ibn Arabi starting after the Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk lands. The sixteenth century was an age of change for the Ottomans. The period also witnessed important developments in the evolution of Ottoman Sunnism. Recent scholarship has interpreted this change as a result of the conflict between the Ottomans and their rival to the east, the Safavids, and the Ottomans’ pursuit of legitimacy in this context. However, the role of the Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate has not attracted the attention it deserves. This thesis concetrates on this overlooked aspect of early moderm Islamic history and explores the Mamluk scholars’ perception of the Ottomans as newcomers to the Sunni tradition. According to them, the Ottomans were not “Sunni enough” and they were exceeding the limits of the sharia and sunna. At least, according to al-Halabi, the doctrine of the Oneness of Being (wahdat al-wujud) of Ibn Arabi that was widely accepted in the Ottoman lands by sultans and the chief jurisprudents was definitely out of the limit.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (863k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

It considers and in large part rejects older attempts at explanation that depended on outdated assumptions and underdeveloped arguments. This study presents a range of conjectures to explain the historical circumstances surrounding the passage and repeal of Novel 106, conjectures that give more weight to the role played by two notoriously corrupt officials in promulgating the new law. On this reconstruction, earlier legislation by Justinian regulating interest rates had substantially reduced the interest rates that could be earned on maritime loans, which became much less profitable. Lenders sought legislation to return to the status quo ante. Their efforts were successful, perhaps as a result of illicit intervention by one or both of the quaestor sacri palatii, Tribonian, or the praefectus praetorio Orientis, John the Cappadocian. The new law led to an increase in the real interest cost of maritime loans. A reaction ensued from the shippers (ναύκληροι) or merchants (ἔμποροι) that relied upon maritime loans to finance their activities. These groups may in turn have applied for redress to the imperial bureaucracy, perhaps to the very same two officials. Novel 106 and its repeal through Novel 110 may therefore represent an instance of the charge made against Tribonian in Procopius Wars 1.24.16, namely that he sold the repeal of some laws and the passage of others, as the needs of his (presumably paying) clients might from time to time require.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (960k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

One of the manuals currently experiencing renewed interest is the Taktika of Emperor Leo VI the Wise, a late ninth-/early tenth-century military handbook that has had a significant impact on the genre of Byzantine military literature. Recent treatments of the text-particularly John Haldon\'s 2014 commentary and Meredith Riedel\'s 2018 book on the religious aspects of the military in the Taktika-find instead that the Taktika reflects Leo\'s wide-ranging articulations on the religious convictions of the Byzantine oikoumene. Despite the increasing attention on the underlying message and place of the Taktika in Leo\'s ideology for the Byzantine empire, however, so far little work has been done on deconstructing the narrative layers of the text. The manual\'s professed aim is to educate generals, and its contents describe the ideal conduct and characteristics of the model general. If the general is the proxy by which Leo articulates a deeper theological argument about the identity of the Christian empire, as Riedel argues, or reacts to his sociopolitical anxieties, such as that of the balance of power between the emperor and Ã©lites in the Byzantine administration, then a close examination of the elements which constitute the Taktika\'s model general is a necessary first step to understand the didactic filter lying between the historian and any ""deeper"" readings of the manual. In light of this, I offer in this paper an analysis of Leo\'s ideal general in the Taktika. I argue for a didactic dimension of the Taktika and contextualize the development of the archetype of the virtuous and pious general as it eventually appears in the Taktika in relation to the manual\'s literary tradition in order to demonstrate what Leo means to communicate to readers approaching the text as a handbook. By doing so, I demonstrate both the foundations and innovations of the ideal general of the Taktika.  Following a historical review of Leo\'s reign and literary production, in Chapter 1 I focus on literary influences and the lineage of the ideal general, with discussion on the genre of military writing in Antiquity and Byzantium and the particular tradition in which the Taktika is situated. In Chapter 2, I examine the text of the Taktika itself in order to demonstrate how Leo crafts the image of the ideal general in the handbook, as well as how he aims to craft ideal generals out of his audience. I examine particularly details about the structure of the manual, Leo\'s selective reception of older sources, and the coherence of didactic and political themes in the manual as a whole.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (930k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The study examines both the proper narrative recreation of battles –and the role that bishops played on them– as well as the relation that those war episodes had to the process of identity-building inside the bishoprics of Liège, Utrecht and the archbishopric of Trier. The bishops’ invincibility, is stated, should be understood as a narrative characteristic. The analysis is based on a given survey of historiographical narratives and bishopric deeds from which the episodes of battles are examined together with their narrative association to the episcopal identities. To analyze the scenes of battle, the methodology consists on a narratological analysis of specific passages in relation to the shaping of combat spatiality. Regarding the link between war scenes and identity, the study examines the diverse strategies of identification which the texts expresses and the ‘grammar of identity’ that support them. Once related, these two approaches show that the narrative invincibility of the bishops was built on a pattern common to diverse Lotharingian written sources in the analyzed period. This pattern consists on separate the combat scenes into spaces of positive singularity and negative plurality. Since the bishops enhanced the positive singularity among their own troops, they narratively avoided the military defeats. This narrative ‘Invincibility’ of Lotharingian bishops helped the chroniclers to project onto the past an episcopal identity that would be protected by those unbeatable prelates.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (709k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

It focuses on two texts which have always been acknowledged to display considerable interest in provincial life: the Advice and Anecdotes of Kekaumenos and the Grottaferrata version of Digenes Akrites. By adapting the rich cultural-geographic concept of “landscape” to the study of premodern narrative, however, this thesis demonstrates that their interest in the space of the borderlands is still deeper and richer than has been understood. The argument proceeds in three stages. The first addresses the most “stereotyped” environment of all, the idyllic locale of the classical locus amoenus. It shows how Digenes plays on this space’s associations with practical advice about the correct site for a military camp—relayed also by Kekaumenos—to integrate this motif into the wilderness of the frontier. The second explores how that wilderness is presented by Kekaumenos. It suggests that he combines narrative techniques from historiography with advice inherited from earlier military treatises to teach the unique perspective of an experienced general, the way such a commander “reads” the land. The final chapter treats Digenes’s wilderness in detail. It demonstrates how landscape there works in multiple ways—often in ones directly antithetical to Kekaumenos’s—in order to define its protagonist as a heroic lone warrior, not a general.  In all these cases, this thesis suggests that landscape implicates more than simply terrain. It serves also as a means by which these texts to present larger, otherwise purely notional spaces, such as the imagined worlds of literary traditions or the imperial-political geography of the border. The thesis concludes by suggesting how this insight might be extended to the study of Byzantine literature more generally.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1113k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

Concerning the possible meaning and function, the painting is investigated within the context of fifteenth-century devotional attitudes, interpreting it as an Andachtsbild. A multilayered meaning is revealed in the interplay of various iconographic types that is understood within the framework of affective piety and thus connected to emotive and mnemonic aspects of private devotion.

Dd is one of the earliest and richest in reader comments among The Canterbury Tales. To map the reception of a literary work, there are three sources that a researcher can turn to: forms of imitation, re-invention, and commentaries. This thesis focuses on the marginal commentaries found in Dd which is the most densely commented one from among the early manuscripts thus being outstandingly informative about the historical reception. The commentaries in Dd have not been completely cataloged and extensively discussed so far. In order to interpret the notes from the margin, I collected, categorized and analyzed the marginalia. On the basis of this, I defined the provenance of Dd more precisely than it was known before and with the help of paleography, I distinguished and dated the annotators of the main body. The provenance defined the social layer of the owners and readers (aristocrats, college masters and members of the church), provided details of the owners’ erudition and about the terminus ante quem of marginalia in Dd. The thematic analysis of these annotations revealed the individual use of the manuscript. Based on these two sources, I determined the connection between the annotators and the main body of the text, The Canterbury Tales. Comparing these results to the seventeenth-century reception history of Chaucer, the seventeenth-century commenters show anomalia. Although Chaucer was generally not appreciated in the seventeenth century, this thesis revealed that among the annotators of Dd there were four hands from the seventeenth century who were deeply engaged with the content of The Canterbury Tales continuing the sixteenth-century interpretation.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (4048k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

Therefore, I study materials of Hungarian vernacular architecture, such as stone, straw, earth and wood, answering the questions, if their use is sustainable today, what the applicable practices of their traditional use are, and if they are able to form structures suitable for the needs of the visitor’s facility. As the walls of the planned building will be constructed with the help of volunteers, I analyse the wall techniques of the present-day practice based on traditional methods from the viewpoint of their feasibility in a construction camp. For this reason, I made interviews with experts of these structures. As a result of the research, I present the design, which keeps parts of the original barn, and uses for the new structures loadbearing timber frame infilled with several wall techniques, made of earth, wood, and straw. The popularity of low-tech constructions using natural materials is increasing in Hungary, therefore this topic gets special attention today.

The analysis of those works, closely connected to the ruling elites of recently Christianized Central European polities, attempts to address the question of how their authors understood and used the concept of loyalty, one of the fundamental ideas underlying medieval society. The following comparative analysis of the way in which authors of earliest Central European chronicles characterized the content of loyalty as the norm present at the center of multiple societal bonds. As such it finds its methodological underpinnings in the concept of Spielregeln, unwritten but widely known rules governing society, developed by Gerd Althoff. The analysis is divided into parts corresponding to the different social bonds in which loyalty plays an important role and which are depicted in the earliest Central European chronicles: the relationship between God and the faithful, kinsmen, and allies, and between the ruler and his subjects. This approach results in the analysis that shows common ideological underpinnings of the concepts of loyalty used in Central European sources. Despite differences in the overall structures and messages of all three works, they present a vision of loyalty as primarily a reciprocal bond, even in the asymmetrical relationships between believers and the divine or subjects and rulers. This highlights the ideological message of consensual lordship, which coexists in those narratives next to the strong ideas about the divine origins of dynastic authority.

The impact of the Pymander influenced other intellectuals like Lodovico Lazzarelli, who trying to find a place in the court of King Ferdinand of Aragon or in Pontano’s Studio, wrote the Hermetic dialogue Crater Hermetis synthesizing Ancient, Neoplatonic, Platonic, Jewish, Christian, and Hermetic concepts. Therefore, through a transtextual analysis of the aforementioned texts from Ficino and Lazzarelli, some Hermetic concepts will be discussed, such as the contemplation, prisca theologia, the dignity of man, or the creative capacity of humans, among others; framing the Hermetic thought of this period.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (720k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

Thus, I aim to reveal the sixteenth century layer of Saltıknâme which is accepted in the scholarship as originally a fifteenth century text, although it is a highly edited text including many anachronic elements and anecdotes, and its original version is lost. I argue that the manifestations of heroism which Sarı Saltık displayed in this text show that his portrayal and that the sixteenth century copy of Saltıknâme were reconstructions built in accordance to the Ottoman Sunnitization process conducted by the Ottoman state and ulama to serve the political needs of the Ottoman state in the sixteenth century. I also argue that Saltıknâme reflects the ongoing rivalries between the Ottomans, the Safavids, and Habsburgs, and mirrors the apocalyptic atmosphere of the period with its anecdotes on shared prophecies across the Mediterranean, millennial anxieties, fears, and some soothing and encouraging messages to its audience against those concerns.

At this time, Ottoman intellectuals translated works from Arabic and Persian, commenting on, excerpting, and rearranging them to instruct Turkophone readers in various sciences and transmit the knowledge from the wider Islamic world. This period also coincided with the dissemination of lettrist practices, as well as proliferation of messianic ideas and movements with different political agendas. The courts, including Ottoman, sponsored occultist cosmopolitan intellectuals who viewed lettrism as a “queen science” of the impending messianic age. It is against this background that the thesis approaches Manyasoğlu’s work that was compiled and presented to Ottoman sultan Murad II in 1438. The thesis argues that ‘Acebü’l-‘Uccāb differs from contemporary lettrist and occultist works because it largely disregards millennialist, messianic, gnostic and Sufi perspectives, and focuses more on the experimental and replicable nature of the occult practices than a mystical chain of transmission. Moreover, it strives to activate occult properties for the practitioner’s benefit rather than solve the theoretical problems of the cosmos. By juxtaposing it to the contemporary “cosmopolitan” occult works, the thesis argues that this lettrist text reflected Manyasoğlu’s vernacular authorial strategies not only in terms of language but practice of the occult as well.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (988k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The choice of the author who is under the patronage of the grand vizier of Sultan Mehmed I illustrates the court’s mentality of placing themselves as a state in a wider universal history in the post-Timurid Anatolia. This thesis researches the reasons of its author Abdülvâsi’s preference of an ancient prophet as his work’s protagonist to present Sultan Mehmed I and his grand vizier Bayezid Pasha as pious Islamic rulers. The methodology used is both from the disciplines of religious studies and history. As a religious text, Hâlilname presents an ubi sunt pattern to its audience, and this religiosity is compared with its contemporary sacred discourse and historic-religious advancements. The major findings of this thesis are (1) being the scholar of the court, Abdülvâsi differs from the early Ottoman hagiography who were critical about classic Perso-Islamic sedentary state policies. (2) The author legitimizes his patron’s actions through history writing and drawing parallels with ancient Perso-Islamic heroes. Abraham with other prophets and some ancient Persian mythologic kings named in Hâlilname are presented as archetypic heroes of justice and piety. Their endeavours such as enforcing justice and producing wealth were followed by Sultan Mehmed I and Bayezid Pasha. (3) Abdülvâsi draws on isrāʾīliyyāt mostly found in classical ḳiṣāṣ al-anbiyāʾ books and a tafsir named al-K̲h̲aṣṣāf to develop his Abraham legend.

The spatial and temporal framework is set within the imperial court of the great khans residing in Karakorum and Khanbaliq from the early thirteenth century to 1368. Based on the critical analysis of multilingual written primary sources, Chinese and Latin in original, Persian, Mongolian, and others in translations, as well as visual materials, this thesis presents an inner view of the mechanism and performance of gift-giving in the Mongol imperial court. Methodologically, inspired by the concept “social life of things” and “object biography” developed by cultural anthropologists Arjun Appadurai and Igor Kopytoff, this thesis sketches three major stages of the biographies of gifts: 1) from where, by whom and what kinds of gifts were sent to the Mongol imperial court, viz. the network of gifts; 2) under what ritual and spatial context, these gifts were presented in the court; 3) after the reception, in what place and under by whom these gifts were kept, based on what rules they were distributed, and in what way there were consumed, in other words, the afterlives of gifts. In contrast to the traditional scholarship stressing the avarice and excess of the Mongols in demanding gifts, this thesis argues the Mongols practiced a well-set protocol regarding the reception and management of gifts in the imperial court. This protocol was applied in the diplomatic encounters, further embodied in the ritual occasions such as the enthronement of great khan, the birthday celebration of the great khan as well as the New Year’s celebration, and attested in the repository, (re-) distribution, and consumption of gifts. Additionally the Mongol khatuns notably participated in the reception, distribution and consumption of gifts. Overall, the Mongol court practices of give-giving is a continuation of the centuries-long Central Eurasian court traditions, in terms of power mechanisms, essentially no alien to their counterparts.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2066k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

John Climacus in the fifth step of his Ladder paid special attention to the discourse on penitence describing his experience of visit into monastic prison where multiple male subjects tormented their sinful flesh. Through the gory descriptions of injured corporeality John in the parabolic way created the image of the ideal and visible repentance. I argue that in the descriptions of corporeal suffering and self-humiliation of penitent subjects, John’s narrative in the seventh century still relied on the metaphorical structures of the Early Christian language of martyrdom. In John’s nararative the connection between the act of repentance and corporeality was explicit and even accentuated. In the edge of millennium, Symeon the New Theologian delivered to his monks a Catechetical discourse about the practice of penitence. In this catechesis, he quoted the same fifth step of John’s Ladder recommending his monks to consult the whole excerpt. Further in his discourse, Symeon introduced to the audience a practice of repentance which included individual staged performance of prayer recitations intermingled with self-beating. In this way, as I demonstrate, Symeon attempted to set a role model to imitate for his monks. This model relied on the reinterpretation of John’s discourse, even though the idea of sinful flesh was not explicitly present in Symeon’s text. I claim that for Symeon repentance was not explicitly connected with the sinfulness of flesh but rather with historical and archetypal inability of humanity to perform proper repentance. This inability started with Adam and Eve’s failure to repent in Paradise. Symeon saw the history of corruptible existence as a history of portion of flesh which had been taken by God from the Adam’s side and transmitted through generations to the Theotokos’ womb preparing Christ’s Incarnation. For Symeon then, the act of repentance became a necessary act performed before the reception of Eucharist. So, repentant partaking of Christ’s deified flesh is a culmination of history of corruptible materiality. Repentant Eucharist, for Symeon, redeems the Adams reception of fruit and his failed repentance. In this way, Symeon embeds the penitent subject into the long history of Christian eschatology making salvation happen through the decisive act of repentance here and now every time during the communion.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (806k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

This dissertation motivated by two research questions: How did private towers appeared and shaped their urban surroundings during the thirteenth century’s urban development? And based on the towers structural and topographical remains what kind of functional role can be attached to them? To answer these questions, I examined the architectural and archeological remains, the topographical distributions and the social background of this building type. This comparative analysis surveyed forty-nine towers and fifty-one mentions of private towers in detail.  With the help of comprehensive and comparable data, the towers materialize as a complex urban form with distinctive functional aspects, and the findings also underpin that their main role was the representation of their possessors’ wealth and influence in the city. This symbolic value is traceable both in their foundation at the most prominent locations of the towns in the early phases of urban development and in their formal aspects. As the social stratum that had originally commissioned them gradually disappeared from the urban fabric, private towers lost their significance by the late fourteenth century. However, the present thesis shows that this emblematic structure continued to represent power in a different context, shifting from the individual toward the communal.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (67385k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The main argument is that creating trust relations is a prerequisite for ensuring the profitability of the pre-modern economic system and that the distribution of trust and distrust can tell us much about its functioning.

Broadly, the image of the Ottomans emerging from these accounts was one that scared European audiences, but during the sixteenth century it slowly changed, as these descriptions began to display admiration towards the Ottoman Empire.

The indigenous riddarasǫgur (chivalric sagas) adapted their setting, themes, and topoi from European romance literature, seemingly completely superseding those appearing in earlier Icelandic works. The riddarasǫgur introduced chivalric literature to an environment where it had no precursor and no social basis, yet it quickly spread and acquired immense popularity that persisted for centuries. The sudden shift in the interest of saga authors and compilers is usually explained with the necessity to adjust and reformulate Icelandic identity after the widescale political and social changes that began in the late thirteenth century. This thesis uses four of the riddarasǫgur, all belonging to the subgroup known as meykongr (maiden-king) sagas, to examine the ways European identities were perceived, received, and adapted in late medieval Iceland. I investigate the textual presence of Otherness in order to explore this interaction of identities and the subsequent results. Alterity being a key element to the identity-building process, I analyze the forms it takes and the groups that represent it in these sagas, from the repulsive and monstrous to the familiar but foreign to the close but marginal.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (747k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

This concerns the problematics of practice of artistic creation, transfer of knowledge and, cultural and historical interpretations and evaluations of mosaic art equally. The purpose of the study is to offer the proposal for understanding and interpretation of heritage of the creative practice of mosaic art, from the standpoint of present-day mosaic creation practitioners. While two main goals of study are: • To examine and to reconcile the understandings of the heritage of mosaic art and heritage of mosaic creation practice in contexts of visual art studies, cultural heritage studies and art education. • To propose a model of heritage of mosaic creation practice, taken from the perspective of mosaic creators by realizing of how the heritage of mosaic art, and heritage of mosaic art creation practice are related to contemporary mosaic design and contemporary mosaic creation practice.  Main results brought by this study are: First, the study itself is the proposal of the model of understanding and interpretation of heritage of the creative practice of mosaic art taken from the standpoint of present-day mosaic creation practitioners. Second, there are three critical Insights about phenomenology of mosaic art and phenomenology of mosaic creation practice summarized by the study, these are: • Mosaic artists and artisans find that the critical part of mosaic art heritage is the body of knowledge and experiences related to the mosaics creation. This knowledge is represented and embodied as the system of mosaic design, while the creative experience of each mosaic maker is individualized and unique. Both, the body of knowledge and the body of experience are mutually interconnected and culturally and historically grounded. • The existence, historical persistence, active use, and specific character of the mosaic design system combined with creative experience, allows novel artistic solutions to be created within the bounders of formal aesthetical and technical properties of the mosaic art-form. This setup defines the mosaic as distinct traditional visual art practice and as distinct visual art-discipline equally. • Transfer of the knowledge and experience of mosaic creation practice between individuals, groups, communities, and generations, makes guarantee of existence, persistence, and continuity in using of mosaic creation practice in human civilization across time, space and cultures. Concerning the methodology, the conducted research was based on, on researcher`s extensive artist-professional experience in creating mosaic artworks and in teaching mosaic art to the students as well as on theoretical and practical examination and analysis of sources and data relevant to study subject, their mutual interrelations, and their relations to their referent socio-cultural and historical contexts. Study has its meant for being used as guidelines or as assessment to help scholars, researchers, educators and activists, in designing various educational forms and programs for teaching mosaic art, as well as in developing various programs and projects dedicated to the heritage of creative practices of visual arts in general.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1553k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

On the other hand, the Association needs to strengthen its brand and network building efforts and develop its lateral and central communication methods. With sufficient human resources the organization can decentralize in the future, and PIM would remain only as its administrative center.

My research included interviews with decision-makers and cooperation with the local community, as well as analysis of the Polish monument protection system and recent investment projects in Radzyń district. A study of global tendencies and current needs of the Radzyń district shows that the heritage-based revitalization can enhance the development of human capital in the area, which will directly lead to the desired economic progress.

Chandannagar, the focus of research in this thesis was formerly administered by the French authorities until the independence of the country in 1947 from British rule. This town, owing to the political administration and influence of the French for centuries, features a unique architectural style in the buildings constructed during that period which is reflective of the confluence of the two cultures. Recently, however, these buildings have seen rapid decline, mismanagement and demolition owing to rapid urbanization, shortage of funds for restoration and the lack of awareness among the local community in the town about the value of the built heritage. These buildings are both public and privately-owned. In both cases, many of them are either sold to realtors and demolished or left to decay. This thesis aims to analyze the role of the community in the heritage management system and showcase the relevance and inevitability of community participation to ensure sustainable development and preservation of built heritage. The primary objective of the thesis is to evaluate the reasons for low community participation and offer solutions to include the community into the heritage management process.

It is because Bhutan’s readiness to implement cultural heritage protection and preservation is so far behind the rush to socio-economic development. The rich cultural heritage of Bhutan is something to be proud of, a treasure preserved by its late opening to modernity. However it was only recently that some degree of heritage conservation has gotten underway but these initial developments are still fully dependent on external expertise for government projects. The non-government custodians of much of the still living heritage lack either the support of external expertise or heritage experience in their restoration and rebuilding efforts, especially in the centuries old traditional monastic heritage. This precarious state of cultural heritage in Bhutan calls for a holistic understanding of the cultural heritage and its preservation as well as development of a basic academic guide to proper research and conservation methods. This thesis presents the complex nature of monastic heritage in Bhutan’s past and present, what these structures mean from a socio-cultural point of view and best approaches to sustain these religious institutions in the present circumstances. In this thesis, I undertake a comparative analytic approach to understanding the historical and religious narratives connected to landscapes with the focus on masonry remains and especially ruins.

A community’s heritage cannot be protected without including their traditional practices in governmental management plans or policies concerning national parks in Ghana. Conflicts often arise whenever heritage bearers are not actively involved in their heritage. The existing relationship between the locals of the Se traditional area and the governmental agency for the protection and management of their heritage in the Shai Resource Reserve, suggest that there is no symbiotic relationship with regards to collective preservation. The problems between government stakeholders and the Se local population started when the Government of Ghana designated the Shai Hills Resource Reserve a protected area which led, the reservation rights under the management of reserve the Forestry Commission under the jurisdiction of the Government of Ghana. This research is necessitated by the existing management plan of the Shai Hills Reserve that does not include elements of the traditional practices of the Se people that are relevant to both the locals and the reserve. The data collection methods used for this research was participatory observation, unstructured interviews and online research regarding local participation of the Se in their heritage. The purpose of this thesis is to propose a revised management plan that will include selected traditional practices relevant to the Se community and the reserve in the interests of promoting a reciprocal system of preservation between government stakeholders and the Se traditional people living by the Reserve. The aim is to promote a “revised” relationship based on the integration of traditional and emergent preservation practices for the benefit of the reserve and not to change the existing plan in a way that suggests it is wrong. On the contrary, the work gravitates towards a modernization approach that is open to emerging best practices. It is hoped that a proposed revised management plan can ultimately be put into practice for all community-based heritage sites in Ghana.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (3623k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The findings of the research help understand how the Hungarian museum sector can overcome some of these binding challenges by understanding that the pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, social,) are interconnected and apply to both audience-facing museum activities as well as internal operations and management.

Zambians used traditional names in precolonial times. Contact with European Christian missionaries and British colonisation from late nineteenth century to independence significantly changed naming practices. As in other colonies, European Christian missionaries and colonial authorities discouraged the use of traditional Zambian names in colonial Zambia in their quest to propagate European ideals. This was because the names were closely linked to local traditions, which missionaries considered as pagan. As a result, Biblical or European names were assigned to Zambians on conversion to Christianity, during school enrolment or job recruitment. On the other hand, the introduction of permanent surnames during the colonial period has helped preserve many traditional names and inspired creation of new surnames from nicknames, colonial concepts and localised forms of European languages. After Zambia gained political independence in 1964, the new government embarked on promotion of local culture. In addition, the older generation were keen on reviving their traditions. As a result, use of traditional first names became common. Charismatic churches in the postcolonial period, like the European Christian missionaries earlier, also discouraged usage of traditional names. The methods used in this study included ethnographic research in Chongwe, Kafue and Lusaka districts and quantitative analysis of names of University of Zambia (UNZA) graduates between 1976 and 2016. Zambian traditional names are linked to many aspects of cultural heritage, including indigenous religion, initiation and clans/totems. From the interviews, it was established that Zambians were made to change their names by adopting European/Biblical names in the colonial period. Related to this, the low percentage of local first name usage (7.9%) among 1976 UNZA graduates confirms the colonial/missionary restrictions on the usage of the names which existed when the graduates were born. Usage of local first names increased in the following decades, to 18.3% in 1986, 39% in 2006 and decreased to 31.6% in 2016. There was a rise in the percentage of graduates who had names from a mixture of local languages, and the noticeable presence – though on a small scale – of Arabic/Islamic names. The traditional/local name use patterns were different among Zambian ethnic groups; however, all ethnicities experienced increased usage of local names over the study period.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (3880k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

Zimbabwean heritage management is western oriented, meaning it places more emphasis on tangible heritage values i.e. conserving and preserving heritage based on UNESCO`s guidelines. That often conflicts with local communities` initiatives with regards to use of archaeological sites and interpretation of heritage values. That is, AICs in Trelawney believe their use of archaeological sites reinforces their connections with their ancestors, who intercede for them in matters of daily life. This thesis presents the conflicting heritage values which are evident between heritage managers and the contemporary uses of heritage sites for spiritual vigils by African Initiated Churches that are often easily viewed as detrimental to the scientific preservation of archaeological sites. To some extent, the deteriorated state of Trelawney heritage sites is an after effect of the Fast Track Land Reform Program on these small and less accessible heritage sites. A lack of heritage awareness programs administered through the National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe (NMMZ) among the farmers resettled by the Zimbabwean government within various parts of Trelawney area. The Fast Track Land Reform Program planning or implementation process overlooked the inclusion of heritage stakeholders` views and advice. This equally overlooked the effects of socio-economic and political changes. Trelawney farms showcase the discussion about the complex conflicts in world view between various heritage stakeholders, partly impacted by the controversial Fast Track Land Reform Program in 2000. The thesis concludes with the argument that responsibilities in managing Trelawney heritage sites should be shared between the NMMZ and local communities in Trelawney.â€ƒ', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1829k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

Yet, by the twelfth century, Buddhism weakened for many reasons and Bodh Gayā became nearly abandoned. The main bulwarks of Buddhism were placed outside the former Indian Buddhist region, and the Buddhist memory of the Mahābodhi in India started to fade away. However, in the nineteenth century, revivalist movements turned the history of the site into a different direction, and Buddhists from abroad declared their intentions to reclaim their Buddhist heritage. By the twentieth-century independence of India, with the work of Burmese rulers and devotees, Sri Lankan activists, and British archaeologists, Bodh Gayā tended to become the center of the Buddhist map again. On the one hand, this meant the change of the religious, social, and economic scenery of the site, which with the intervention of secular bodies into religious matters, and Bodh Gayā’s designation as a World Heritage Site, also brought growing tensions and contestation. On the other hand, the reconnection provided a tool for the players of the pan-Buddhist world, to incorporate the memory and heritage of Bodh Gayā into their current national narratives. One of the most peculiar examples of these is the case of Thailand, a country entering the “revivalist” picture quite late compared to its Burmese and Sri Lankan peers. Yet, it happened at a time when the monarch needed all the legitimation and support possible. We may observe, that from 1956, Thailand established many connections with Bodh Gayā through means of ‘soft power’ and this process has also lead to the emergence of new practices in the homeland, such as erecting replicas of the Mahābodhi. In my thesis, I analyze these points of connection and compare them with the possible political aims behind them. Additionally, I scrutinize the means of commemorating Bodh Gayā in Thailand focusing on the changing motives and practices.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2376k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

The disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought about drastic changes to the status quo in Tajikistan, and the newly created sovereign state had to redefine its identity. Still, Dushanbe has preserved a substantial amount of Soviet architecture, which is disappearing year by year due to the decisions of public authorities. Facing the lack of transparency and dialogue on behalf of the decision makers, the residents of the city have initiated a discourse in the online realm, in social media, where they discuss their memories and the value of the cityâ€™s architecture through photos about Soviet Dushanbe. To understand how the residents perceive and relate to the architecture and urban space of the Soviet era in Dushanbe, this thesis explores the heritage discourse around those in the framework of memory studies and visual analysis. The main body of sources are photographs about the urban space and architecture from the Soviet period, preserved even after the independence in personal collections and recently shared in social media, and the discussion that has evolved around these. The thesis contrasts this discourse of private memories to the one initiated by the state and other public actors also applying images of the city as media and compares the modern image and the narrative of the city to the one established and maintained in the Soviet period both in visual media and in printed literature. Dushanbe as the capital city is seen by all actors as a product of Soviet architectural practices: it was born and developed during the Soviet Union, witnessed its collapse, and is thereby indispensably connected to the Soviet era. In the Soviet period, its image was based on that of a young city, and this image keeps on dominating the official discourse even today. This narrative, however, has led to the conclusion on behalf of the authorities that the city does not have any historically valuable architecture. The residents are not asked about the issue, they have no say in the decision making about urban development. The findings of the thesis, however, show that the residents have a strong opinion about the architecture and urban space of Dushanbe, but the failure to critically rethink the heritage value of the Soviet architecture has led to a complete disconnect between the state and the people, the latter being utterly unhappy with the recent direction of urban transformation. To bridge this gap, it would be essential for the state and the city leadership to explore the current heritage and memory discourse among the residents, which would help to understand the place and role of Soviet architecture in the twenty-first-century Dushanbe and could serve as the basis of decision making concerning the development of urban space.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (8353k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

That is, a structured dissemination of partial evidence that was perpetrated and to some extent centrally designed by key actors including: the state, local historians and educational institutions as part of concerted attempts to entrench overarching notions of national cohesion and unity in the face of (re)imagining the Ghana’s colonial past. I contend that what this topic lack is ample/fair representation in the Ghana Education Service’s current teaching curriculum for history in senior high schools. Thus, a continuous minimization or outright silencing of the role played by local agency prevents students from developing nuanced insights into a lived past within Ghana’s national consciousness, in the contemporary imagination and interrogation of the manifold of events that transpired in Atlantic slave trade. Historically relevant sites like Fort William, Anomabo—this thesis’s case study—was explored and can serve as an entry point into this complex history.

The purpose of this work is manifold, it looks into the reevaluation of the earlier studies, applies a new methodology with new sets of data and provides analysis of a wide area with case studies from the main regions of medieval Transylvania. Based on these features the dissertation builds up a fresh approach and analyzes how far Transylvania represents a unique area as the eastern border region of the Kingdom of Hungary in terms of monastic landscapes. In the same time, the inquiries focus on whether Transylvania as a historical region can be defined as an independent, unitary monastic region. The analysis reaches beyond the church and the claustral buildings and uses all forms of evidence to understand the monastic landscape. To a limited extent it also aims to understand pre-monastic landscapes as well as the post-monastic period to investigate what effects did the dissolution of a monastery had on the region and how it changed the land use. Thus, the present dissertation initiates in-depth case studies on the settling features of monastic orders in medieval Transylvania and analyzes their landscape shaping and land use activities through a holistic approach. The following questions constitute the basis for the research: When and how did the estates of various abbeys spread over Transylvania? What was their relationship with the surrounding neighbors? Can property clusters be recognized? If so, then what could influence the structure of monastic clusters? Can perhaps, preferences of certain types of lands by the monastic orders be recognized? How can the estates of a monastery be identified and their boundaries pinpointed on the ground? What can still be recognized or found on the field? How did the monasteries use their lands? Can different monastic landscapes be identified based on the types of estates and land use of the abbeys? Are there differences among the orders in terms of land use and income? The dissertation is structured into six chapters. The Introduction contains the Aim and structure, the Methodology, the Evaluation and review of the sources and a Literature review. In the second chapter (Monasteries in time and space) the definition of medieval Transylvania is discussed based on the local characteristics and differences within the Kingdom of Hungary. How is it different from the other historic regions of the Hungarian Kingdom? Why can it be analyzed separately? What factors define its uniqueness? Then, a short introduction and discussion follows on the history of the four orders, which constitute the subject of the dissertation, with special emphasis on their presence in Transylvania. Finally, an assessment of the research of the medieval monasteries is presented. The third chapter (Kolozsmonostor abbey and monastic land use) launches the case study and landscape analysis of the largest Benedictine abbey of Transylvania focusing on the land use of the abbey with highlighted case studies of selected study areas from Kolozs County, such as the monastic villages in the Kajántó valley and along the Nádas. In addition, a general discussion of all the monastic properties can be found grouped by historic counties, their location within the counties and connection to Kolozsmonostor. The chapter contains a literature review and a short history of the abbey pinpointing those events that affected the property structure and land use of the Benedictines. Chapter four (Kerc Abbey and its lands) zooms in on the only Cistercian abbey of medieval Transylvania as a detailed case study of the close environs of the monastic buildings as well as a discussion of the monastic properties. The chapter contains a review of the historic setting and literature with special attention to the issues connected to its foundation. The inner and outer precinct of Kerc could be reconstructed based on detailed field surveys this is also presented in detail. The fifth chapter looks into the topic of Pauline micro landscapes with a case study on the monastery in Marosszentkirály but looks into the sources of the other existing Pauline houses as well. Finally, the Conclusions discuss the results of the research and provide insight into further possibilities of investigation. The results indicate that the monastic property structures evolved separately and particularly for each abbey based on the endowments, local circumstances, and social relations. The land use patterns identified in this dissertation also influenced greatly the stability and survival of the abbeys. In some cases, like for Kolozsmonostor or Kerc the central property blocks developed by the fourteenth century and provided constant income for the communities. Although Kolozsmonostor lost a significant part of its distant lands to lay landowners, its main properties (some of which were extensive) remained in the abbey’s possession until its dissolution. Kerc also managed to keep and to develop the monastic villages around the abbey. In the case of the Pauline monasteries cash income was higher while apparently they owned less landed property than Kolozsmonostor or Kerc. However, Szentkirály received a large number of land donations but their extent is not known thus, it cannot be compared to the Benedictine or Cistercian lands. What is sure is that the Paulines were the most involved in lease agreements, as it is nicely outlined by the high number of mills and mill places. Concerning the land donations, the Paulines received the highest number of small, scattered lands in several villages (usually land plot with or without houses), so they did not really own entire villages (with few exceptions, see Unoka, Toldalag) like the Benedictines or Cistercians. The Paulines in Szentkirály received so many donations in Zekelfalva that at least half of the village ended up in their possession, so they too managed to form a stable base close to the monastic buildings. The collected data outlines that various monastic landscapes co-existed which together formed a distinct monastic region in Transylvania with a particular development for each large abbey. As the maps illustrate, the earliest Benedictine communities were concentrated in northwestern Transylvania, in the royal counties and the situation remained the same after the Mongol invasion, with the change that only Kolozsmonostor survived. The easternmost male Cistercian abbey in Europe was royally founded in Kerc, in southern Transylvania (in Fogaras Land) in the early thirteenth century, while the Pauline monasteries lined up along the Upper Maros River and its close environment in the fourteenth century. Chronologically, in very general terms, the first were the Benedictines in northwestern Transylvania, then the Cistercians in southern Transylvania, and lastly the Paulines in the middle, along the Maros River. It seems that all three religious communities (Benedictines, Cistercians, and Paulines) settled and maintained their presence in three distinct parts of medieval Transylvania. All monasteries were situated on smaller hilltops close to significant roads or trade routes, larger towns or market towns as well as rivers. However, at the same time, one might interpret medieval Transylvania as a particular region within the Hungarian Kingdom, where the monastic orders adjusted to the local characteristics and privileged communities, and formed their property clusters close to the abbey buildings. Thus, the small number of monastic houses (in contrast to the higher number of mendicants) can be regarded a characteristic feature of medieval Transylvania. Perhaps it would bring new results if a similar analysis of the mendicants would be added to the monastic orders.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (11904k)'}"

It attempts to define the ktetoria as a total social phenomenon manifesting itself in various aspects of Byzantine and Slavic Societies (such as flows of capital, land accumulation, state ideology, rhetoric, literacy, archival techniques, visual artistic expression, self-representation of individuals, and many others). It approaches this phenomenon by regarding the actors (patrons, founders, sponsors, benefactors), their motives, actions, and objectives, and their recipients, the ecclesiastic institutions and communities of believers. This approach enables me to look at the patronage through the eyes of the medieval practitioners of the ktetoria, and to understand the ways this practice functioned in the Medieval societies. For the practitioners, the pious patronage encompassed three forms of benefactions: a foundation of an ecclesiastic or philanthropic institution; endowment with lands, land income, or other goods; and donation of precious objects. Consequently, I regarded these activities not as separate customs but as components of one tradition of pious giving to ecclesiastic institutions and I approached this tradition through the in-depth analysis of case studies based on charters, church inscriptions, and votive portraits. The first chapter of the dissertation deals with the overview of the approaches to the patronage studies and the problems associated with them. It covers such problems as research on Byzantine and Slavic foundation law and traditions, theory and practice of gift-giving in the medieval Christian countries, the understanding of relations between the patronage and royal authority, as well as the representations of patrons and their meaning. Besides the Introductory chapter, the dissertation is divided into two parts encompassing the examinations of foundation activities and gift-giving practices, described broadly. This perspective facilitated the comparison between these two pious activities and the terms applied for their description by the medieval sources. Thus, the second chapter aims at the typology of private ecclesiastic institutions in Byzantium and Medieval Balkan countries. It takes a closer look at a wide range of privately-established ecclesiastic institutions whose size and purpose varied greatly, from the small household chapels to great hermitic monastic communities. It comes to conclusion that all these foundations can be divided into two predominant types: family institutions and hermitic communities. A family institution was meant for daily services, celebrations, burials, commemorations, and retirement of the members of one family and preserved certain ties with the profane world surrounding it. On the contrary, as a case study of Hosios Leontios of Monembasia and his monastery demonstrated, a hermitic institution was founded by a group of persons connected with spiritual ties who separated from the world and tried to achieve the spiritual perfection. The intentional seclusion and focusing on religious matters allowed to these monasteries to gain spiritual capital from the members of lay society and, therefore, to receive financial support from various external sources. The third chapter focuses on patterns of ecclesiastic patronage, namely, it defines the use of the titles of the first and second ktetor as well as the modes of collective patronage. The studied material proved that the Byzantines and Balkans Slavs didn’t differentiate between the initial founder and second and/or secondary founders of various types. The status of ktetor could be transferred or shared in several ways: through hereditary lines; because of the ties of respect, apprenticeship, or friendship; for the political benefits received by foundations; due to a shortage of funds; by the appointment of a Patriarch etc. In this paradigm, ktetoria became a denomination for financial sponsorship and patronage, protection, but also preserved its initial meaning of (re)foundation, (re)construction and (re)building. Due to various social and political motives the acts of ktetoria could be undertaken as a group effort, by several persons in association as well as consecutively. In such groups one or several persons were the initiators and/or leaders of the patronage deed which was emphasised by the means of iconography and rhetoric. The fourth chapter juxtaposes various images depicting the secondary ktetors, namely, the sponsors presented as supplicants and the portraits of the founders’ children included into the votive compositions. In both cases, the depicted figures had a smaller measure of participation than the main founders, but their social status differed. If the secondary ktetors, depicted as small-scale figures or commemorated in additional inscriptions, were either the successors of the initial ktetor or the minor economic sponsors, the children participated with their future inheritance in the foundation. Moreover, the depiction of children was applied as a communicative tool: this way, the portraits demonstrated the succession in the inheritance of economic and political rights and preserved the memory about the family’s status and wealth. The fifth chapter deals with the exclusive rights of the founders in the opposition to that of the sponsors and patrons, and investigates two problems, related to the church dedication and the mentioning of political authorities in the dedicatory inscriptions. Thus, founders used the ecclesiastic institutions under their patronage for the shaping and promotion of their public images whereas the act of foundation itself was regarded as a reflexion of the founders’ identities, religious belief, personal hopes, political affiliations, economic might, family position, and social achievements. The choice of spiritual patron for a foundation was one of these identity matters that, as the case study of the Hodegetria’s churches proves, depended on the pious believes and political motives of the commissioners. More precisely, such circumstances as a desire to imitate the arrangements of the capital or an acquisition of a personal replica of the famous icon could influence the selection of the dedication. On the other hand, the references to the wordly authorities in the church dedicatory inscriptions can be perceived in the context of changing political landscape on the Late medieval Balkans....', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

The saint gained great prominence there around the middle of the fifteenth century, when he started to be celebrated as a patron saint of Dalmatia. His image became ubiquitous in the main urban centers of the region. Artistic productions that represent the image of Saint Jerome form the main body of evidence for this thesis. By analyzing these primary sources, observing the correlation of St. Jerome’s artistic representation together with devotional literature and archival sources, and placing the commissions in historical context, this work redresses a significant omission in historical and art historical scholarship which has previously failed to adequately present the significance of his cult. This thesis questions the hitherto established historiographical conclusions regarding the veneration of the saint in the region considered to be his patria and by the people who saw themselves as his compatriots, and offers a fresh perspective on the formation of the regional peculiarities of the cult. The dynamics of adopting the popular and widespread humanist cult that bloomed in the Apennine peninsula at the period is presented. However, the emphasis is placed on its subsequent adaptation and the development of the cult’s regional characteristics, which resulted in Jerome’s image as a national saint within the early proto-national narratives emerging among the Dalmatian and Croatian intellectual elites. While the general focus is placed on the contextualization of the regional and national aspects of veneration, the thesis also analyzes the saint’s cult in Dalmatia as a reflection of different cultural, intellectual, devotional, and political changes during—politically unstable but culturally advanced—the fifteenth century. Such an approach underlines the advanced humanist circles in the communes as the main factor in cultural progress. Jerome’s image is rooted in numerous aspects of Croatian culture and spirituality during the late Middle Ages and through all subsequent centuries: this determines his position as a Croatian saint. Due to the ramifications of the cult, the reach of the cultural environment in which it takes place, the number of the peculiar expressions of the cult, and the involvement of the bearers of regional Renaissance culture and intellectual development, the veneration of the saint is observed as a mirror of Croatian Renaissance production.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'DOI: 10.14754/CEU.2020.10', 'Access': 'PDF file (11472k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Despite that, the eleventh and twelfth centuries in Hungary were of major importance regarding the foundation of the state, and with it, the formation of (secular and ecclesiastic) power structures, sources about this period are rather scarce, primarily written evidence. Opposite to that, archaeology can provide a large amount of data. In the framework of the present study, I have compiled a database of rural local churches, field cemeteries, and ecclesiastical and secular power centres (bishoprics, monasteries and castles), altogether nine hundred and sixty-three sites dated to the eleventh and twelfth centuries, implemented them in a geographical information system, and analysed their relation to each other, resulting in a sequence of twenty-four maps. An analysis with such an extensive database, especially from the point of view of the early development of the rural church network is something that has not been conducted yet. Since the problem of Christianisation is an interdisciplinary issue, which has been discussed much by historians, it was inevitable to discuss its problems and compare the results of my analysis of the existing historical theories. With that, a unique narrative of the process became available, based on a phenomenon, the development of the rural local church network, which almost does not appear in historical sources, and on a source material that otherwise was not in the focus of research. In Chapter II, I have demonstrated during the discussion of these problems, the – otherwise scarce - historical sources had a too excessive impact on the interpretation of the archaeological material, especially when considering that the majority of that, including the rural churches and cemeteries, appear the least in such context. This historical argumentation manifested mostly in the ambiguous dating, and controversial interpretation of field and transitional cemeteries, and the emergence of the local, rural church network, including, of course, the contentious issue of pagan-Christian transition, and the (semi-) nomadic lifestyle. Considering the disputes around the historical sources, I concluded that the investigation of the question should be in a broader spectrum, using Big Archaeological Data in order to escape the projection of historical ideas on the analysis of the archaeological material and contextualise it within the framework of the contemporary ecclesiastical and secular power centres. In Chapter III, following the problem-oriented historiography, wrapped around the sources and methods that are used in the present work, it is essential to discuss the disputes in the light of the methodology and interdisciplinary approach of the present thesis, as Christianisation was in high focus of the researchers of multiple disciplines, and therefore its results are somewhat scattered and often controversial. In Chapter IV, based on the analysis of the archaeological material, I have demonstrated that in the context of the eleventh century the spatial distribution of secular and ecclesiastical power centres – castles, monasteries and bishoprics display a complemental system. Castles were creating a peripheral, defensive line, supplemented by monasteries in the middle range, and the positioning of the bishoprics closest to the inner areas. Enhancing this with the investigation of the rural churches to the places of central power, it became visible that opposed to the general expectation, early churches ‘avoid’ the immediate surroundings of the castles, and seldom occur together with monasteries or bishoprics. Presupposing that such centres served as centres of Christianisation, this is a rather remarkable result. The results of my analysis have exposed an even distribution of churches, with a little more density in the areas lacking ecclesiastical and secular power centres, and a smaller density of field cemeteries around those. With this, my investigation has confirmed that the ecclesiastical institutions belonging to them most probably had pastoral functions over the neighbourhood. Secondly, I have demonstrated that the even distribution of rural churches, including areas lacking central power centres speak of a well-designed act of building up political power, and together with it the state religion on the lowest level. Examining the relations of early churches and field cemeteries, with special regard to transitional cemetery types, also applying Thiessen polygon catchment areas I have found out, that the distribution of the field cemeteries often can be found along the edges of the catchment areas of the churches. Concerning transitional cemeteries, I have demonstrated that it is no different in chronological or spatial distribution of transitional Type 1, and Type 2 cemeteries. Therefore, it seems like that regardless of the regulations of church law on the positioning of churches and ‘pagan’ burials, and also the endless debates that research was conducted on the ‘Gellértegyháza-type’ cemeteries, the exact positioning of the field cemetery and the church is irrelevant, although the direct building on a field cemetery proved to be more common. It also has to be noted, that the frequency of occurrence was equal in the eleventh and twelfth centuries as well, which first and foremost points out that it was probably regarded as common practice; and secondly, it might be connected to wooden churches, and their archaeologically mostly undetectable character. This provides further considerations on the quantitative difference between the eleventh and twelfth-century rural church network as well. Furthermore, I have pointed out the serious problem of the frequent tendency of research to judge the character of the cemetery based solely on some grave finds, and classify them as field cemetery or maybe even ‘pagan’, even if the finds cannot be associated with pagan beliefs. However, the clustering of transitional cemetery types cannot be associated with any specific, ‘pagan’ areas of the Kingdom. I have also demonstrated that contrary to earlier theories, transitional cemeteries cannot be connected to the underdeveloped ecclesiastical system. With the similar analysis of the twelfth century I demonstrated, that the general distribution of the rural churches did not change significantly; some expansion can be observed on the northeast, and a little more extensive one in Transylvania. However, the largest difference is the density of the churches, which can partially be connected to the taphonomically more favourable conditions – more lasting building materials. Perhaps the opposite can be suggested in intensively researched areas with a relatively low count of churches, such as Tolna county, where a more dominant presence of wooden churches can be presupposed. With the overall evaluation of the spatial analysis of the twelfth-century material, I have concluded that the density of the churches, especially the even character of the church network (disregarding the area of southeastern Transdanubia, and the extra density of the more researched areas) demonstrates a stable local church network in the twelfth century....', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

For the first time, aristocracies from throughout the Mediterranean world were amalgamated in one hierarchically-structured institution. Viewing the Mediterranean world in the period covered by this thesis – from the accession of Constantine I to the death of Theodosius I – as characterized by the same political, economic and institutional factors, the period, whose end, by contrast, marks the beginnings of a divergence between the West and the East, I explore the cultural impacts of the formation of a new trans-regional governing class of the fourth-century Roman Empire. Two paradigms of the relationship between state and senatorial aristocracy shaped modern historiography. Firstly, the conflict paradigm of senatorial resistance against the imperial state, which, according to its narrative, shaped the relationship between aristocrats and emperors, breaks down if one sees the state not as inert administrative machine, but as ‘an ensemble of groups’ whose interests had an autonomous social character.3259 The change in the imperial and senatorial selfrepresentation, with relative independence of senatorial representation from the imperial model, was not underpinned by a conflict of these two social forces. Imperial policies were inseparable from the powers and pressure of important groups within imperial aristocracy, and the leading families in the Roman senate were amongst the main beneficiaries of the fourth-century shifts in governmental structure. In the course of this examination it becomes clear that a conflict model, so often postulated as a determining relations between the aristocracy and state, is in no way an adequate explanation for the changes in honorific epigraphy and representational art. Given the quality of imperial relations with both the old senatorial nobility in Rome and the new service elite, and the continued importance of both senates as a source of legitimacy for fragile imperial rule, the period saw intense collaboration between the imperial aristocracy and the court. The increased integration of the Roman senators into the imperial system allowed to establish and enlarged the senators’ powerful networks of patronage. Instead of senators simply monopolizing the offices and the institutional machinery of the Roman state for their private interests, emperors through the select appointments to the high governmental posts were able to manipulate aristocratic patronage and personal power networks.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (6928k)'}"

Judging by the great number of surviving murals with their image, the representation of the holy kings of Hungary on the walls of churches was a highly-popular phenomenon during the Late Middle Ages, which served both religious and political purposes. The collective representation in church painting of the holy kings of Hungary – namely, St. Stephen (r. 1000/1001-1038), the founder of the Christian Kingdom of Hungary, who deserved his sanctity for having ruled as ""rex iustus"" and having converted his people to Christianity; St. Emeric (1000/1007-1031), the former’s son, a pious and chaste prince, who was educated to become a virtuous Christian ruler, but died before succeeding his father to the throne; and St. Ladislas (r. 1077-1095), ideal ruler and knight, the country’s defender against pagan enemies, and ""athleta patriae"" – appeared as a consequence of their joint cult which emerged around the mid-fourteenth century in the royal milieu. During the reigns of King Louis I of Anjou (1342-1382) and King Sigismund of Luxemburg (1387-1437), this collective depiction spread in great extent among the noblemen of the kingdom. It then continued to be popular among the country’s various estates and ethnic groups throughout the following century and until the spread of the Reformation. The first chapter of the dissertation offers a general overview of the cults of the three holy kings of Hungary from their emergence as individual cults (around 1083 and around 1192, respectively) to their configuration as the cult of holy predecessors for the last Árpádian and first Angevin rulers, and as a politically-motivated joint cult during the reign of King Louis the Great of Anjou. The combined discussion of both written and visual sources is meant to offer an integrative perspective to the complex cults of the three holy kings of Hungary, underlining their various stages of evolution. The chapter discusses first the characteristics of the holy kings’ individual cults and then looks for evidence in the time’s written sources for the merging of the individual cults into a joint cult of the holy predecessors of the Árpádian and Angevin dynasts. It underlines the royal support of this cult and highlights its various purposes, i.e., to revere one’s holy predecessors as a guarantee of things’ good functioning, or to acquire sacred capital and political legitimacy. By looking both at the Hungarian (Árpádian and Angevin) and foreign (Neapolitan Angevin) visual evidence, it establishes the moment of emergence of the iconography of the three sancti reges Hungariae around the mid-fourteenth century. Although the support of this cult is mainly a royal affair during the second half of the thirteenth and the first half of the fourteenth century, other supporters and promoters (e.g., ecclesiastical figures, noblemen, burghers, etc.) started to appear during the second half of the fourteenth century. These new supporters and promoters contributed to the generalization of the cult, that is, the spreading and transformation of the ""sancti reges Hungariae"" into the patron saints of the country. Because the first murals with the holy kings’ collective image started to appear only during the late-fourteenth century, this first chapter has the purpose to offer the background information for the cult of Hungary’s holy kings and the premises for understanding their representation in religious mural painting. The iconographic analysis of the murals depicting Hungary’s holy kings commences with the next chapter which examines the main iconographic features (both individual and collective) of the representation in religious mural painting of the Hungarian royal trio. By looking into the question of patronage and commissionership, it establishes that the donors’ motivation for venerating the ""sancti reges Hungariae"" and for having their images in church decoration were both devotional and political. It then shows how the pictorial trio of Hungary’s holy rulers was employed in various historical circumstances for the purpose of political propaganda and how, by means of complex visual and heraldic strategies, the collective image of the ""sancti reges Hungariae"" conveyed efficiently ideological messages. Continuing the iconographic analysis, the following chapter examines in detail another iconographic type which gathers only the effective rulers and excludes St. Emeric. After examining in detail the iconographic characteristics of this group of murals which selects Sts Stephen and Ladislas only, places them on the pillars of the triumphal arch, and depicts them in the company of the Old Testament Prophets, the analysis turns to the discussion of a number of various written sources (e.g., political-theoretical and historical works, saints’ lives and offices, sermons, etc.). They reveal the attempt of medieval authors at shaping the image of the two holy kings after the model of the two Old Testament Kings Solomon and David, presenting thus St. Stephen as a predominantly wise and righteous ruler and St. Ladislas as a predominantly brave and strong ruler. These sources help one understand the reasons why the two Hungarian holy kings have been depicted in the company of the Old Testament Prophets, whereas the architectural symbolism of the place their images were located in (i.e., the pillars of the triumphal arch) reveals the awareness of medieval iconographers that Sts Stephen and Ladislas have been ambivalent figures, both sacred (saints) and secular (kings), and that they have been the embodiment of the two main royal virtues, namely, wisdom and strength. The examination of the frescoes’ chronological distribution reveals that this iconographic type precedes the depiction of the ""sancti reges Hungariae"" as a trio, whereas looking into the problem of commissionership establishes another interesting devotional pattern for the donors of murals depicting Sts Stephen and Ladislas. Examining both written and pictorial evidence, the next chapter addresses the diffusion of St. Sigismund’s cult from Bohemia to Hungary during the late-fourteenth century and the saint’s subsequent transformation during the fifteenth century into one of the patrons of the country. In so doing, it assesses the significance of King Sigismund’s actions to promote his personal patron in Hungary and shows that the king emulated the model of his father, Charles IV of Luxemburg. King Sigismund promoted his spiritual patron within his country and associated him with St. Ladislas, the traditional patron of Hungary; he succeeded, thus, to accommodate the foreign saint to a new home and to transform him for a short interval into one of Hungary’s holy protectors. The natural consequence of this “holy and faithful fellowship” was the cult’s transfer from the royal milieu to that of the kingdom’s nobility. Willing to prove their loyalty to the king, Hungarian noblemen decorated their churches with St. Sigismund’s image and depicted him in the company of the ""sancti reges Hungariae"". This chapter illustrates how a period’s political transformations facilitated the spreading of a new saint’s cult from his cult center to another region, and that a saint’s veneration was sometimes motivated politically. The next chapter is a complex case study which examines in detail those representations of holy kings that have been commissioned or used by Orthodox Romanians, as well as those depictions made by painters of Byzantine tradition, who worked for either Catholic or Orthodox patrons......', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (31349k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

This inquiry involves an interdisciplinary approach, combining history, theology, philosophy, and philology. At the beginning of the fourth century, after Christianity changed its status from persecuted to official recognition in the Roman Empire, an “ascetic revolution” spread especially among the members of the high aristocracy and of the middle-class. Sometimes several members of the same family, men and women, embraced the ascetic enthusiasm, experimenting with different ascetic modi vivendi in proximity to each other or in cohabitation. While authoritative Church Fathers legitimized some of the newly emerging communities, at the same time, they rejected other forms of double-gender asceticism, which they labelled as chaotic and “unruly.” Family double monasteries are rooted in the pious Late Antique households, generally belonging to the high aristocracy, with one notable exception – precisely the very one that had set the tone for this practice. Relatives, men and women, shared their inclination towards asceticism in proximity to each other either on their own family estates, or in new places. They formed quarters of monks and nuns who belonged to the same monastic unit, sometimes having a unique guidance (often a woman), they were economically and liturgically interdependent, but they lived separately and their encounters were thoroughly regulated. Thus, the flourishing communities which sprang from a family milieu and received the recognition of the Church Fathers are, in chronological order, the monastery of Tabennesi (Upper Egypt), founded by Pachomius and his sister, Mary (ca. 333-336); the monastery in Annisa (Cappadocia), which developed on the family estate of Macrina the Younger, her mother, and her brothers (ca. 345-356); the community founded in Bethlehem by Jerome, his brother, Paulinianus, and his spiritual daughter, Paula, together with the latter’s daughter, Eustochium (386); the monastery of Nola, founded by Paulinus and his wife, Therasia (395-396), which became a magnet for other ‘monastic spouses’ and formed a monastic network; the monastery which emerged at Primuliacum due to Sulpicius Severus, his wife, and his mother-in-law, Bassula (396-403); and the monastery founded on the Mount of Olives by Melania the Younger, her husband, Pinianus, and her mother, Albina (431-436). At the same time, other spouses renounced their matrimonial relations and continued to live as spiritual siblings in their own pious households, which they slowly transformed into ascetic dwellings, or, rarely, fled elsewhere. Not all the monastic spouses founded new communities, but some of them either joined already existent monasteries, or, after years of living in proximity, they separated. This thesis analyzed them as part of the double gender family asceticism which was recognized and legitimized. In the secondary literature scholars have been using the terminus technicus “double monastery” almost indiscriminately, for all eras and for all the regions, with the meaning of a coenobitic establishment that hosted ascetic men and women in seclusion. Generally, the term was opposed to other types of double gender communities called “mixed monasteries,” “neighbor monasteries,” or “distant monasteries.” Literature published from the nineteenth century until today distinguished two main stages of research, one lasting until the beginning of the twentieth century, and another one which started at the end of the 1980s. In this period, two disciplines, history and Church law, have been dealing with the problem of double monasteries. The syntagm “double monastery” cannot be easily applied to the fourth-century context, since the terms “duplex monasterium” and “διπλοῦν μοναστήριον” are first attested in 546, in Justinian’s Novel 123, while sources never use the other terms proposed in scholarship. However, since in English no other syntagm is able to cover accurately the particularities of the fourth- and fifth-century communities that my dissertation scrutinizes, throughout my work I conventionally referred to them by adopting the formula “family double monasteries.” Several common conditions led to the gradual development of this model of monasticism. First, a charismatic ascetic man attached to his male monastery a community of pious women who followed him and he set up a set of rules which concerned both groups of ascetics and their interaction. In other instances, men and women relatives transformed their “pious households” into ascetic establishments. In this case, they did not cease to live in the same environment, but at a later stage in their evolution, groups of monks and nuns were secluded, and a set of rules established the legitimate contacts between them. Yet, in other situations, relatives founded a community for both monks and nuns in a different place than their household. Such a place attracted other ascetically oriented family members, creating ‘monastic networks.’ Finally, in some situations, spouses decided to renounce their family connections and to become ascetics. Sources describe several stages in the accomplishment of such a decision, which had noticeable consequences at the social level. The sources pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the communities which my thesis investigates are mostly written. The hagiographies, letters, monastic rules, dialogues, homilies, sermons, and poems have their specific set of rules which concern their production, audience, and way of dissemination. Most of the sources belong to more than one category, a fact which is not surprising for the fourth-century context. Moreover, all the texts have male authors, a detail which becomes essential when analyzing references to ascetic women.....', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1861k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Along with Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Lodovico Lazzarelli and many others, Agrippa belonged to the type of humanists who sought to reform or “enrich” Christianity by introducing elements from various heterodox philosophical and spiritual traditions. Agrippa himself was most fervently dedicated to the study of magic, in which he recognized an ancient wisdom tradition compatible with the genuine spirit of Christian teachings. The result of his lifelong studies was his well-known encyclopedia of magic, De occulta philosophia libri tres (Three books of occult philosophy), in which he presented and discussed practically all the forms of occult knowledge known in his time. On the other hand, Agrippa was actively engaged in the religious controversies and theological debates of his time, taking sides with Biblical humanists such as Erasmus and closely following the emergence of Martin Luther’s movement and other Reformation groups. This other major field of his interest resulted in the production of non-magical works either of skeptical-devotional character, such as his famous declamation De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum et artium (On the uncertainty and vanity of sciences and arts), or of theological and exegetical nature, such as his less known treatises De originali peccato (On the original sin) and Dialogus de homine (A dialogue on man). Taken in its entirety and at its face value, Agrippa’s literary opus reveals an author with incoherent and sometimes mutually conflicting attitudes. Reading his works suggests a tense coexistence of a Hermetic magus who relies on personal initiative for gaining supernatural powers and a Christian humanist devoted to the principle of sola fide. Agrippa’s apparently inconsistent religious and philosophical convictions still remain a considerable hermeneutic challenge. The existing scholarly interpretations of this problem are usually based on two types of dichotomy perceived in his thought: that of Agrippa’s skepticism versus his religious devotion, and that of Agrippa’s involvement in the occult versus his self-proclaimed adherence to Christian orthodoxy. In my dissertation I revisit the second dichotomy, that of Agrippa’s dedication to the theory and practice of magic vis-à-vis his religious self-identification as a pious and devoted Christian. More precisely, I examine a hybrid notion that Agrippa attempted to articulate and defend against his critics: that of a pious Christian magician, which is how he fashioned himself in some of his writings. My dissertation is a further development of the ideas delineated in my MA thesis, in which I analyzed Agrippa’s magical doctrines and argued that they were based on the notion of spiritual ascension or deification—in other words, that they were eminently religious in nature. In my work I focus on the apparently Pelagian character of Agrippa’s understanding of ascension, especially when considered in relation to the other, supposedly orthodox side of his thought. I approach the problem by analyzing Agrippa’s works in the perspective of his anthropology and with the idea that his views on man can help us clarify his ambiguous position in the intellectual history of the early sixteenth-century Europe. I start off with the presumption that Agrippa’s anthropology is a meeting point between the magical and Christian sides of his thought. By anthropology I imply a complex set of beliefs, notions, and doctrines concerning issues such as the self, personhood, the relations between body and soul, etc. that governed Agrippa’s understanding of the phenomena he dealt with in his writings. Thus, my main research questions can be formulated as follows: what, according to Agrippa, constitutes the human being? How does he understand the relations between body and soul? What is Agrippa’s attitude towards the physical body, which plays a crucial role in the Christian doctrine of salvation? What is man’s position within the created world and with regard to the transcendental realm and God? How did man get to the created world and how does he leave it? Finally, what do Agrippa’s anthropological views tell us about his religious self-identification? Can they shed more light on the problem of his evident heterodoxy and self-proclaimed orthodoxy? The main sources for my examination are Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia and three smaller treatises that have so far received little scholarly attention, although they are of paramount importance for understanding Agrippa’s anthropology. These are De triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum (On the three ways of knowing God), the unfinished Dialogus de homine (A dialogue on man), and Agrippa’s only surviving exegetical work, De originali peccato (On the original sin). Occasionally, I also take into consideration Agrippa’s second major work, De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum et artium, as well as small parts of his huge surviving correspondence. To my knowledge, none of these works has been systematically analyzed in the context of Agrippa’s anthropology and I hope that my dissertation will contribute to filling in that gap in the pertinent scholarship. The methodology applied in this work is twofold: the first step consists in a careful philological analysis of the passages from the above-mentioned works which are of relevance for my research questions. I am particularly interested in Agrippa’s terminological choices and the meanings with which he loads the chosen terms, especially with regard to his sources of references, both synchronic and diachronic. In other words, I provide a comparative perspective by juxtaposing the texts I analyze with those that Agrippa drew on in his own search, ranging from the earliest (such as Plato’s) to the more or less contemporary texts (such as Ficino’s and Lazzarelli’s). The second step consists in developing an interpretation of Agrippa’s anthropological views based on the analyzed texts and within the conceptual framework of the academic study of Western esotericism as a newly emerged branch of religious studies. Finally, this leads to an interpretation of Agrippa’s religious self-identification and the problem of his orthodoxy, which I address by proposing a polyvalent notion of piety and a tripartite model of Christianity. Throughout my analysis I take into consideration what I call a “linguistic turn” in the present-day scholarship on Agrippa: an increased awareness and recognition of his literary and rhetorical strategies, especially his nuanced and intentionally ambiguous style of writing and argumentation based on his conviction that the true, inner knowledge should be concealed and protected from the unqualified or malevolent readers. The main body of the dissertation is divided into five chapters. In Chapter One I provide a necessary historical introduction with an emphasis on those aspects of Agrippa’s life and writings that I examine more closely. In this chapter I also give a detailed overview of the relevant scholarship and discuss my own approach and methodology with regard to the main research questions. In Chapter Two I scrutinize the basic tenets of Agrippa’s cosmology and cosmogony with the idea that they are intrinsically linked to Agrippa’s views on man’s nature and his ontological status, in tune with the well-known Renaissance idea of the correspondence between the microcosm and the macrocosm. Chapters Three and Four form the core of my analysis of Agrippa’s anthropological ideas. In Chapter Three I argue that Agrippa articulated his views on man in two triads: that of soul, body, and spirit, and that of sensitive soul, rational soul, and the mind. I analyze each of the triads in the context of perceived tensions between the anthropological monism peculiar to the orthodox Christianity and the anthropological dualism more closely related to the Neoplatonic and Hermetic paradigms. In Chapter Four I apply the results of my analysis to Agrippa’s magical theory with the idea of elucidating the mechanisms lying behind different types of magic. I argue that his magical theory is intrinsically tied to his religious self-identification. Finally, in Chapter Five I examine Agrippa’s ideas on man’s fall and salvation, mostly on the basis on his treatises De triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum and De originali peccato. In my analysis of the latter, which is Agrippa’s only extant exegetical work, I demonstrate how the German humanist interpreted the Biblical account of the fall in the predominantly Hermetic conceptual framework. In the end, I use the results of my analysis to focus on the problem of Agrippa’s religious self-identification and offer a new interpretation of the tense coexistence between the two sides of his eclectic thought. Based on my examination, I come to the following conclusions, which are here delineated in a necessarily simplified form....', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (6187k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The title of this dissertation is an allusion to the same or similar philosophical examples that are present in Late Antique Greek and in Indian philosophies separately, without any explicit means of transfer. Similarly to Śaṅkara’s unrefuted opponents, in the dissertation we attempt to give a logical explanation to these parallels. In our approach to comparative philosophy, this study engages in questions of historical influence between philosophical texts. Other types of philosophical, i.e. structural, conceptual, or phenomenological comparisons are also justified, which consciously avoid the question of influence. The present research, however, is explicitly dedicated to the question of influence from India to Greece, or vice versa, and as such, is intended to be a continuation of previous work done by other scholars regarding the texts examined here. The dissertation comprises two case studies in comparative Late Antique and Indian philosophies. The first one focuses on two similar passages in the work of Porphyry (233–305 CE), Neoplatonist philosopher, and Śaṅkara (cc. 8th century CE), the most illustrious representative of Advaita Vedānta philosophy. The similarities, discovered by Émile Bréhier in the 1950s, are studied for the first time in their original languages. The polemical texts refute the idea of the creation of the world, while maintaining its ontological dependency on the highest principle. Due to a detailed textual and contextual comparison, the conclusion is drawn that the similarities on the surface do not involve structural and conceptual connection between the two texts. The parallels are mostly confined to metaphorical ways of expression, which, on the other hand, undoubtedly exist. These metaphors that are present in both texts were most probably due to intellectual exchange – even if not due to influence out of textual contact but most probably due to verbal communication. Both texts are deeply embedded in their own traditions and display several layers of previous philosophies. It is difficult to tell in what period the parallel expressions were transferred from one culture to the other. It seems practical to postulate a “common pool” of philosophical expressions, a certain distinct philosophical language, which was available to philosophers of both cultures. Various authors used these metaphors as building blocks in the expression of their theories – they used them as it best fitted their purposes. The second case study is concerned with the writings of Sextus Empiricus (2nd–3rd centuries CE), Sceptic philosopher, whose works show a remarkable plenitude of similar elements that occur abundantly within various kinds of Indian philosophies. Following Aram M. Frenkian’s investigation, our study re-examines the three elements identified by Frenkian as Indian influences in Sextus’ oeuvre: the smoke-fire illustration, the snake-rope analogy, and the quadrilemma. The same elements, among others, were identified by Thomas McEvilley as evidence of Greek influence upon Madhyamaka Buddhism. After inspecting the supposedly earliest occurrences in both Greek and Indian philosophy and literature, we have to acknowledge, at least until other evidence occurs, that these three elements are not indicators of borrowing – they probably form part of the shared metaphors and ways of expressions described above. There is one exception, however, in the case of the smoke-fire example used in the theory of signs, when not only the illustration but the whole theory is present in both traditions – but due to lack of other evidence and especially, due to the lack of clearly determined chronologies, it is difficult to assess the actual type and cause of intertextuality. The dissertation provides historical and theoretical background to the philosophical comparisons: the well-known and vivid trade relations between the Mediterranean and India in the first centuries of the Common Era, and the Indian presence in Egypt, also the Greek-speaking merchants staying temporarily in Indian ports, together with possibly the descendants of Greeks from the time of the Indo-Greek and Bactrian kingdoms, made exchange of philosophical ideas, and even more, diffusion of ways of expression possible. The study is placed within the theoretical background of the Mediterraneist–thalassological approach suggested by Braudel, Horden and Purcell.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2762k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Already his contemporaries noted about Sigismund of Luxembourg that he was often short of money. Many of his lenders considered him a bad debtor, his brother Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia and the Romans, accused him of being irresponsible regarding finance management, and there was even an anecdote mocking the king who was drowning in debt. To ease this financial pressure, Sigismund often turned to his favored method of raising loans secured by pledges of royal domains. In light of these antecedents, it came by no surprise that the majority of the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century historians generally had a crushing opinion on King Sigismund’s finances in Hungary. Since the 1930s, successful attempts were made to rehabilitate Sigismund’s image in the historical discourse. As a result, even such opinions emerged according to which Sigismund was ahead of his time in economic thinking. These more recent views interpret the many loans of the king as a necessity for the successful governance and not as an unnecessary tool for keeping up his luxurious lifestyle. Nonetheless, even after the radical change in the tone of discourse, our knowledge about the ruler’s fund-raising method continues to be limited to the results of the research primarily conducted in the 1930s. The present dissertation aims to update and enlarge upon these limited conclusions The works written on the topic studied this issue on its own and never in a broader context, therefore the aim of Chapter 1 is to show that the case of Sigismund of Luxembourg’s Hungary was not an isolated instance but on the contrary, pledging was a known fund-raising method in almost all royal courts of Europe. The major difference was the extent to which the crowned heads were relying on pledges. While in the West (of the continent) it did not become a common tool for complementing the ordinary revenues, in Scandinavia and Central Europe it was so widespread that a historian suggested the introduction of a new era for the Holy Roman Empire, called the “era of pledging.” Pledging played a major role in Sigismund’s reign in the Kingdom of Hungary right from the onset. It helped him to fulfill his claim to the throne of Hungary, which became questioned after the death of King Louis I in 1382. Sigismund managed to overcome the difficulties of rising to power in the country with the help of his cousins the Moravian Margraves, to whom he pledged the territories between the rivers Váh and Danube. Chapter 2 discusses the Moravian rule of this territory, it presents Sigismund’s strategies to regain it, and finally it examines the legal status of the Váh-Danube interfluve during these years. Do the many pledges indicate deplorable financial condition for Sigismund? This is the question that the Chapter 3 seeks to explore. Due to the lack substantial amount of sources, researchers are often left in the dark concerning the precise revenues of medieval Hungarian rulers. Sigismund’s case is different in the sense that there are enough sources preserved to make a rough estimation. During his long reign of fifty years his revenues fluctuated, so most probably he was able to gain more revenues in the second part of his reign. Then he possibly had more than 300.000 florins ordinary revenues annually, which sometimes could rise even to half million florins with the extraordinary revenues. This amount was high enough to consider Sigismund a relatively rich ruler among the late medieval Hungarian kings, also on a European scale his revenues were not negligible. So far, the research of the topic concentrated on estimating how much money Sigismund could possibly raise from the pledgings and how he could spend this amount. As a result, fundamental issues related to the topic have not been addressed, such as how the transactions of pledge worked. Chapter 4 offers an overview of the pledgings’ sources and provides an in-depth analysis of the characteristics and the legal features of Sigismund’s pledgings with the help of multiple examples. The chapter demonstrates that the ruler’s transactions do not show a unified pattern. Apart from certain clauses, which were constant, the conditions of the transaction could vary based on the agreement reached between the ruler and the pledgor. The questions which were in center of scholarly attention up to this point are addressed in Chapter 5. Since many of the transactions’ sources have not been preserved, the precise overall value of Sigismund’s pledgings of his entire reign cannot be calculated. Nonetheless, on the basis of the existing source material this amount should have been certainly more than one million florins, which is twice as much as the sum that the scholarship suggested earlier. The distribution of the transactions was uneven, and a gradual and constant increase can be observed almost throughout Sigismund’s reign. Both the pledgings’ value and the number of concluded transactions indicate that Sigismund pledged the most in the last part of his reign, in the 1420s and 1430s. Thus, most probably, not only Sigismund’s revenues were higher in this period but his expenses too. The reasons behind the increase in pledging were multiple. The Ottoman and Hussite wars, erecting the forts at the southern borders, and the constructions on Bratislava castle have all took their share among others. Besides the money involved in the transactions and the number of concluded deals, the number of pledged castles could be another indicator of the scale of the royal pledgings under Sigismund’s rule. Altogether 93 castles were put in pledge under his reign, which was more than the half of the country’s royal castles, out of which only 20% have been recovered during his lifetime. Besides the castles, a good number of market towns have been put in pledge by King Sigismund. It has been widely accepted in the scholarship that there was a nonalienation concept concerning the seven free royal towns, and it has been suggested that this idea emerged under Sigismund’s reign. However, by looking closer at the sources, it becomes apparent that in several occasions even these settlements have been involved in transactions of pledge. Most commonly this happened in the form of pledging, a source of revenue or a tax of the urban settlement, but it could happen under extraordinary circumstances that the whole town was put in pledge as the case of Bratislava illustrates. In addition to castles and towns, Chapter 6 discusses the issue of the comitatus pledgings. The term was used generally in two senses. In Croatia the administrative units called župe were pledged, while in Hungary the offices of the ispán were given in pledge mostly together with the castles serving as the seat of the ispanate. Finally, Sigismund’s most infamous financial transaction, the pledging of the Spis region is also discussed here. There was a wide spectrum of pledge holders representing various social groups from prelates and barons to burghers and knights, middling nobility and so on. Characteristically, in the first part of his reign King Louis’ old aristocracy —which tried to keep Sigismund’ power in the country limited — was the greatest beneficiary of the royal pledging practice. However, once Sigismund managed to defeat his internal opposition, there was much more possibility for other groups to conclude such deals with the ruler. Among them were the members of the new political elite risen under Sigismund’s rule from the middling nobles, and the numerous foreigners in royal service. Despite the great number of business partners only a handful stands out as the most important pledge holders. These were the two highly influential families of the Frankopans and Garais, the royal consort Queen Barbara, and the Polish King Władysław II who took in pledge the Spiš region. The final chapter is dedicated to the question of spending the sums of the transactions. Up until now it was believed that Sigismund relied heavily on pledgings because he financed his wars in this way. Although war financing certainly played a major role in utilizing the resources provided by the pledges, only about a much smaller amount of money can be claimed with greater certainty that it contributed to bear the cost of wars than it was thought earlier. In addition to this, travel-related costs, recruiting adherents, remunerating their services and costs of constructions were further areas of expenses which Sigismund covered by pledgings from time to time. Pledging away royal domains to complement the ordinary revenues was a known method in medieval Hungary even before Sigismund of Luxembourg’s ascension to the throne. However, his rise to power has brought quantitative and qualitative changes into this matter, since the volume of pledging reached heights unknown before his reign and most probably even after his death. The consequences were severe and long-lasting. Because only a fraction of the pledges had been recovered, the crown had lost its position as the greatest landowner of the kingdom to the aristocracy, and by that it deeply weakened the royal authority. It was not King Sigismund who introduced the practice of royal pledging in the Kingdom of Hungary, but he enormously contributed to the phenomenon that pledging became an almost indispensable element of royal finances after his death.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (8713k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Probably born in the last quarter of the XIth century in northeastern Sicily, at Cerami, Philagathos is mostly known for authoring a substantial collection of homilies for the Sunday readings and the feasts of the liturgical year, the so-called “italo-griechische Homiliar”(A. Ehrhard). The collection of sermons was brought to Constantinople around the middle of the XIII century and it spread in the entire Byzantine world. The enormous number of manuscripts in which the text has been preserved testifies for its popularity – i.e. there are more than two hundred manuscripts containing sermons from the Italo-Greek homiliary. It is the aim of this dissertation to explain this avowed popularity. The groundwork of my investigation consists of a detailed analysis of sources. In this respect, my approach continues previous scholarship, which pointed out the acquaintance of Philagathos with various rhetorical models. However, besides producing new evidence, the present investigation assumes a broader perspective by looking at the compositional technique behind the sermons, at their rhetorical frame and method of scriptural interpretation. Apart of homilies, the analysis addresses Philagathos’ allegorical commentary of Heliodorus’ Aethiopika aiming to revisit the standard philosophical affiliation (Neoplatonic/ Neopythagoric) ascribed to it and to challenge the persistent doubts concerning the Philagathean authorship of this treatise. In advancing my claims, I bring new intertextual evidence that links the commentary with the Homilies, with Heliodorus’ novel and with the writings of Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus Confessor. First, I investigate the relationship between the Homilies and the Byzantine rhetorical tradition and I address the influence of the rhetorical techniques of ekphrasis, diegesis, synkrisis, antithesis and threnos upon Philagathos’ sermons. In this part, I underscored Philagathos’ usage of authors belonging to the second sophistic. Among these sources, significant is the extensive reliance on the late-antique novels, which best speaks of the homilist’s proclivity for depicting emotional states. I have documented the usage of Achilles Tatius and Heliodorus’ novels for describing the episodes surrounding the Resurrection, for embellishing various miracles stories and narrative episodes, for expressing theological doctrines and for encyclopaedic lore. In fact, the overall examination of the rhetorical models affirms the consonance of the Italo-Greek homiliary with the contemporary Byzantine rhetorical taste. For, besides Heliodorus and Achilles Tatius, Philagathos used Lucian, Alciphron and Synesius, which are the authors recommended in contemporary handbooks of style. Next, I discuss Philagathos’ compositional technique and I argue the structure of the Homilies evokes the so-called ‘culture of collection’ or ‘florilegic habit.’ The concept denotes a practice of authorship pervasive in Byzantine culture, which prescribes the appropriation of sanctioned rhetorical and theological models for framing one’s own discourse. In my analysis, I have traced this practice in Philagathos’ method of citation and I have pointed out that this was organized around general themes so as to befit various homiletic contexts. In fact a florilegic habit informs every level of Philagathos’ exposition. At the rhetorical level, the homilist amassed passages for achieving vividness and persuasion. In this sense he collected vignettes about various emotions (i.e. deep grief, mourning, seduction, love, etc.), about descriptions of works of art, of persons, of events, which he retrieved in thematically related contexts. Then, I have documented the same tendency in the accumulation of scientiﬁc knowledge for interpreting difficult passages that turn up in the commentary of the Gospel. Such were the homilist’s inquires into the attributes of the mustard seed, the mandrake, the sycamore, the pods that the swine ate, the anatomy of the eye, or the peculiarities of snakes. Similarly, the citation of numerous scriptural difficulties appears determined again by the homilist’s strategy of collecting passages about the Gospel text under scrutiny. Thereafter, the analysis follows the exegetic division established by the homilist himself. Thus, first I address the exegesis according to the ‘literal–historic’ sense (ἱστορία) and then the spiritual interpretation (θεωρία) displayed in the Homilies. I showed that the approach to the ‘literal sense’ evokes a systematic process of reviewing and codifying the exegetic tradition. In order to substantiate this claim I reviewed the categories of sources from which Philagathos collected various difficulties that questioned and subverted the ‘literal meaning’ of the Gospels. Perhaps the most significative finding is Philagathos’ substantial usage of Makarios Magnes’ Monogenes, a source of whose transmission across the Middle Ages we have little knowledge. The Monogenes is particularly important because it contains the most extensive exposition of pagan rebukes on the New Testament that have subsisted from Late Antiquity. Adolf von Harnack first proposed that the arguments formulated in this treatise originate in Porphyry’s Contra Christianos. Ever since then, the studies on Porphyry’s anti-Christian polemic revolved essentially upon the testimonies derived from the Monogenes. Then, turning to Philagathos’ ‘spiritual’ interpretation I point out that the continuous reliance on the allegorical interpretation of numbers and names characterizes Philagathos’ exegetic style. In particular, I show that Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus Confessor were decisive in shaping Philagathos’ spiritual interpretation. The former is the most cited author in the Homilies. Gregory’s writings were thematically harvested and incorporated in the sermons. Besides ample literal citations, the imprint of Gregory of Nyssa is conspicuous in original adaptations of his theological doctrines. Thus, the doctrine of perpetual progress, of the cardinal virtues or the treatment of hagiographical material is modelled on Gregory of Nyssa’s exegesis. In what regards the emphasis on etymology and arithmology I point out that Philagathos’ exegesis is pre-eminently fashioned after Maximus Confessor’s Ad Thalassium. In the last part, I turn to Philagathos’ allegorical interpretation of Heliodorus’ Aethiopika to which I apply a similar structure of analysis. In other words, I address the rhetorical strategy, the exegetic technique and the theological doctrines displayed in the commentary. At variance with the scholarly consensus which considers ἑρμηνεία as part of the Neoplatonist interpretative tradition I argue that the exegetical practice displayed in the allegory reflects Gregory of Nyssa’s allegorical exegesis and doctrine of spiritual progress from the Homilies on the Song of Songs and The Life of Moses. In what regards the etymological and arithmological exegesis displayed in the ἑρμηνεία I show that this feature bespeaks the influence of Maximus Confessor’ method, which closely mirrors the exegetic technique and the theological doctrines conveyed by Philagathos’ Homilies. The analysis takes into account the extensive intertextual evidence that binds Philagathos’ Homilies with the allegorical exegesis of Aethiopika. The text is situated in the context of the rediscovery of the genre of the novel in Komnenian Byzantium and the Byzantine tradition of allegorical interpretation of secular literature.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

On the other hand, the enhanced self-consciousness or even pride of the Renaissance author compared to that of the earlier medieval one is a long established commonplace; indeed, humanist poets were inclined, in varying degrees, to self-fashioning, self-mythologizing. My interdisciplinary study focuses on the junction of these two basic habits of mind of German humanists around 1500. I reveal solar and astral (mainly astrological) symbolism in Neo-Latin poetical works and visual artworks of this period, and investigate how this cosmic symbolism was used for self-representative purposes. Among the German humanists I focus on Conrad Celtis (1459-1508), the “„arch-humanist” of Germany, the first poet laureate of his nation, the ""bringer of the muses"" to the German land. Celtis\'s personality, poetic talent, ambition, scientific-philosophical interests, his assumed role − all this resulted in various interesting ways of ""cosmic"" self-representation; I argue that this is a core area of his whole poetical oeuvre. In the investigated period of German humanism (c. 1485-1510), some other poets who were friends of Celtis also employed astronomical, astrological, cosmological imagery in the construction of their (or the group\'s) humanist identities, in various ways, to various extent: Jakob Locher, Laurentius Corvinus (Rabe), Johannes Tolhopf, Augustinus Moravus; I involve in my research representative works of these authors, too. The first chapter reviews the poetological background of the enhanced vates-ideology of the German humanists: the humanist revaluation of poetry in the Renaissance and the “„defense of poetry” tradition. The second chapter overviews Celtis’s ideas about astronomy-astrology, micro- and macrocosm in general. Chapters 3-6 explore Celtis’s and his firends’ strategies of “„cosmic” self-representation through analyses of specific works. Humanists could support their vates-role by means of their (idealized) birth horoscope or the horoscope of laureation (ch. 3-4); or they could develop a complex Phoebean symbolism based on Phoebus, the solar god who supports the poet in various ways (ch. 5). Humanist group-identity could be strengthened through a Phoebean-Bacchic symbolism and the mythologizing of humanist feasts (ch. 6).', 'Summary': 'DOI: 10.14754/CEU.2017.01', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (9848k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

I have pursued the goal of shedding more light on the Benedictine context of manuscripts written in Beneventan script in Dalmatia and I have tried to define a Dalmatian variant of decoration accompanying the Beneventan script. The Beneventan script, a minuscule handwriting that developed towards the middle of the eighth century in the Duchy of Benevento was used exclusively in Southern Italy and Dalmatia. It was primarily a Benedictine script, firmly bound to the history of the first Benedictine abbey of Monte Cassino and later Benedictine monasteries in the region concerned. Although the Beneventan script was also used in other Dalmatian towns such as Split, Kotor, Rab and Osor, stress is put on Zadar, Trogir and Dubrovnik because the quality and quantity of preserved manuscripts and fragments that originated in these towns permit specific research questions to be answered. Consequently, the thesis, apart from the introduction and conclusion, comprises three analytical chapters for each of the mentioned towns, hand list of all items written in Beneventan script and related to Dalmatia as well as an extensive catalogue of discussed fragments, mainly still preserved in Dalmatia and manuscripts, which are apart from the manuscripts from Trogir scattered around the world in the libraries of Oxford, Budapest, Berlin and elsewhere. The main concern regarding the chapter on Zadar eleventh century manuscripts written in Beneventan script was to detect the transmission of motifs from Italy, that is to establish a precise repertory of the initials and their origin with regard to Monte Cassino and Apulia. The chapter on Dubrovnik, the richest town in Dalmatia as far as the fragments written in Beneventan script are concerned, focused on the development of the Beneventan script from the eleventh to the thirteenth century and the argumentation for the existence of the Benedictine scriptorium of St. Mary on the island of Lokrum. The chapter on Trogir focused on the analyses of thirteenth century manuscripts written in Beneventan script and preserved in Trogir. I argued that the conservatism visible in the illumination, the script and the choice of liturgical book is deliberate and that the archaic forms were chosen by the Benedictines to testify to a long tradition (suffice it to say that a late thirteenth century Evangelistary from Trogir was thought to be an eleventh century product). This idea was further explored by comparison with other contemporary visual materials with pronounced conservative features and related to the Benedictine context (the illumination of the fragments of the Rab Evangelistary written in Beneventan script, the silver covers of codices from Trogir and Split).', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (10287k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Moreover, changing flood frequencies and flood extremes can be treated as indicators and show strong connection to climate variabilites and changes.

Even if some flood events can be traced in the previous centuries, due to the availability of contemporary source evidence, the database and mass analysis are mainly restricted to the 14th and 15th centuries. Since the last two centuries of the Middle Ages act as a transitional period after the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), and already belong to the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA), the great number of information on the changing frequencies, magnitude and impacts of flood events might provide significant improvement in the better understanding of this – in climatic sense – rather special late medieval period.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (9727k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

During the early and formative years of the Hussite movement in Bohemia, a group of Germans from Dresden who presumably ran a “School” located at the Black Rose House in Prague played an important role in the scholarly disputes of that time. The activity of the School proved to be a stimulating element in religious developments in Prague up until the year 1417, and maintained strong influence on the radical Hussite parties thereafter. Nevertheless, what can be understood under the concept of this particular School remains unclear. The dissertation examines available written sources and scrutinizes the information they contain in order to find out whether the Dresden School existed as a well defined group. As a first step it analyzes the contemporary period when the Dresden School was allegedly in existence. This comprises three stages: firstly, compiling references to the group or its members made by external contemporary sources, be it well-known narrative sources or un-researched manuscript material; subsequently combining these with biographical data of the people and the information they provided about themselves; and lastly, looking for indirect evidence for the existence of the group. The next set of questions is centered around the later stages of the School’s existence and analyzes its “afterlife”. The existence of the School is considered through the prism of its possible influence, namely whether there are signs of its ideological influence on anyone, whether its disciples or supporters markedly shared or promoted identical ideas, or whether there existed any kind of activities that could be generally linked with the consequences of the existence the Dresden School. Several 15th-century manuscript sources that attest to a promotion of teachings of certain members of the School on a theoretical level are scrutinized and edited for this purpose. The dissertation discusses the possible bonds between the members of the Dresden School from various angles. Its main goal is to find out whether the Dresden School existed as a clearly defined group and if so, what kind of group it was or where did its concept originate from. The thorough examination of the above mentioned problems aims at facilitating better understanding of the phenomenon of the Dresden School which has been puzzling many generations of historians up to this date.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (9323k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The creation of the anthology was personally initiated by emperor Alexios Komnenos (1081-1118) and was related with the religious politics of the Byzantine Empire. In the history of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, this anthology remained as an important contribution in the systematization of the legacy of the Church Fathers and the cannon of texts which were used in the theological debates. The text gained considerable popularity with more than Greek 150 manuscripts and translations into Old Slavonic and Latin. The Panoplia consists of 28 chapters. Each of the initial seven chapters is dedicated to an important orthodox belief, while each of the following chapters refutes a major heresy in the history of the Church from the early Christian times until the twelfth century. The text is well known to the scholars dealing with Byzantium but has remained largely unexplored because of its length and monumental tradition. This thesis represents two episodes (loosely connected) in the transmission history of the anthology. The first section situates the Panoplia in the context of early modern Europe with the publication history of the first printed edition in Greek which happened in Wallachia in 1710. The dissertation proves that this edition was initiated by the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem in relation to the proselytizing activities of the Catholics and the Protestants. The inner conflicts among the Orthodox Christians necessitated the edition and the publication was connected with the coeval Eucharistic debates, which had their origins in Western Europe but were interiorized on Orthodox soil. The second part treats one single manuscript – MS Iviron grec 281 -- which shows significant differences from the Wallachia edition and the other Panoplia manuscripts which I was able to consult. Compared to the edition, the Iviron MS omits many of the Patristic texts, but adds scholia to the fragments of Pseudo-Dionysios the Areopagite and the orations of Gregory the Theologian (Orationes 28, 29, 30, 31, 38). The present study gives a sample of these scholia: it treats the fragments of Gregory of Nazianzos’ De Theologia, Oratio 30 and In Theophania, Oratio 38 as well as the five short scholia to the Pseudo-Dionysian fragments. The sources on the scholia to the text of the Areopagite lead to Ambigua ad Thomam of Maximus the Confessor. For the rest of the scholia, I was able to identify most of them as fragments authored by Nicetas Heracleensis and Elias Cretensis, two among the most prominent commentators of the Theologian.

This endeavour involved the deconstruction of a vast corpus of prior historical writings in Greek (at least by 26 historians) into small sections and reconstructing them in a newly arranged systematic order, resulting in the Constantinian Excerpts. This corpus of historical excerpts provides a unique insight in the tenth-century imperial view of history through the selection of 53 subject matters, the tenth-century methods of data management, and the compilation technique, also significant for the more thoroughly understanding of other imperial compilations such as De administrando imperio, De thematibus, and De cerimoniis. My thesis intends to contribute to the achievements of the scholarship in this field primarily by re-studying the manuscripts and analyzing the excerptors` editorial supplements, which have not been published and systematically studied so far. By analyzing the compilation technique of the Byzantine excerptors, my thesis provides a more precise and detailed reconstruction of the method of excerpting, identifies the characteristic elements of this method, which prove innovative in terms of combining traditional techniques, and outlines a possible link between the historical excerpts and Constantine VII`s other projects. As a result of the analysis, I suggest to expand the temporal frame of producing the excerpts. It is argued that the process of excerpting started in the 940s, the production of the final deluxe copies continued after Constantine VII`s death for a couple of decades.

This period marked a new beginning in the history of visual representation in Western art: the picture was no longer conceived of as a two-dimensional surface, but as a three-dimensional pictorial space depicting a world parallel to our own. This shift led to a “realistic” turn of the picture itself. One concomitant of this development was that images-within-images appeared in large number, usually as part of a building situated in the background or an object belonging to the setting. My main question is how these embedded images contributed to the reality-effect of the pictures (by showing them more life-like and detailed). I also investigate how these embedded images facilitated a pictorial reflection on the visual organization of the picture itself, at the same time creating meaning-related associations within the works and thus contributing to their message. This merger of pictorial and iconographic analyses is triggered by the source material, and aims to overcome the artificial methodological separation of the visual and semantic aspects of these works. Furthermore, by investigating the aspirations of the patrons and pictorial developments in the artists’ workshops I aim to situate the results in their broader historical context.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (7687k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Stanislaus was the bishop of Cracow in the eleventh century. His legend tells the story of his conflict with Boleslaus II, the King of Poland, which resulted in the bishop’s murder in 1079. Bishop Stanislaus was canonised by Pope Innocent IV at Assisi in 1253 and became patron-saint of Poland, one of the symbols and icons of Polish history and society. Numerous studies dealt with various issues concerning his legend and his cult, but sermons have been largely neglected. An important outcome of this work is a repertory of medieval sermons on St. Stanislaus, which I managed to identify in manuscripts and inventory in the Appendices (80 different sermons and sermon materials in 86 various codices, which comprise altogether 129 instances in which St. Stanislaus appeared in sermons in the manuscripts dating from the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries). This study examines the relationship between sermons on St. Stanislaus, the construction of his image and the operation, spread, and uses of his cult. Thus, the study presents multiple images and functions of the cult of St. Stanislaus in the Late Middle Ages on the basis of the sermons, and at the same time points to those which were the most prominent and successful. Chapter 1, “The Image of St. Stanislaus in Various Sources of His Cult,” presents the development of the image and cult of St. Stanislaus on the basis of other representations – hagiography, historiographic sources, liturgy, and visual representations. Chapter 2, “The Contexts of Preaching on St. Stanislaus - Preaching Occasions,” provides the background to the preaching on St. Stanislaus and determines the contexts in which the preaching on the saint occurred on the basis of sources other than sermon manuscripts. Chapter 3, “Sermons on St. Stanislaus of Cracow in Manuscript Codices – an Overview,” provides a comprehensive overview of the dossier, showing the variety of sermons and sermon materials present in manuscripts, a listing of which is presented in the appendices for the first time. Sermons were composed by authors from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from Mendicant friars to cathedral, courtly and university preachers, and maybe also parish priests. Chapter 4 is a case study of the most influential sermon text on St. Stanislaus, a model sermon by Peregrinus of Opole, a Dominican friar. The chapter provides a detailed analysis of the sermon, its transmission and reception. The analysis of the remaining sermons focuses on two basic aspects of Stanislaus’ cult: chapter 5.1, An Exemplary Shepherd, deals with the imitable: the image of St. Stanislaus as an exemplar of the good shepherd for contemporary clergy and non-clerical lords as well. Part 5.2, A Powerful Intercessor, focuses on the admirable aspect: the saint as an effective protector and a patron-saint not only of individuals, but also of the community of Cracow, of Poland and of the Poles.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (3003k)'}"

The materials used in the research are the sources of the normative law (the First Lithuanian Statute, the Second Lithuanian Statute, the ducal privileges and the decrees of the Council of Lords) and the records of legal practice (judicial records from the Lithuanian Metrica, the collection of the records of the chancery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). The dissertation concentrates on the analysis of the two coexisting legal models: the contractual provisions and the legal provisions. The aim was to trace the development of these two legal models, to compare them, and to see their reflection in the legal practice. The research showed that there were many similarities between these two models. The factors that were important for the property status of widows were their marital status and their parental status. The main change in the normative laws connected to dower was that of the size of the dower, and this was tightly connected to the general landholding laws. The coexistence of the two different models may be explained by the contractual provisions being easier to reinforce than the legal ones and the fact that the contractual provisions were not mandatory. In practice, many instances, although the law was followed in main features, the position of the widow depended not only on the law, but on the family circumstances, generosity of the husband, kindness and helpfulness or animosity and greediness of the children.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

The study tackles questions of the treasuries’ foundation, growth, function, and place in the medieval culture of Bohemia, and to a lesser extent, their management and content. It is confined to the geographical and chronological limits of Luxembourg and Jagellonian rule in Bohemia, and Moravia, from roughly 1310 –1526. These primarily political dates bear little relevance to any major shifts in the practice of treasuring, but they embrace the flourishing late medieval culture in Bohemia with its excellent – albeit now mostly lost – artistic output. These dates also set limits to a period of great importance in the development and redefinition of ecclesiastical treasuries in terms of their political and cultural roles. My work sheds light on the intellectual concepts and practical policies involved in the development of treasuries in Bohemia. It oscillates between three main disciplines of history: art, religious, and cultural history. I follow the relation of general concepts, both biblical and literary, to treasures and their subsequent transformation in church treasuries. I view the medieval church treasury in its social context as a result of piety, as well as a media communicating the status of an individual or a community, or – as in the particular case of Bohemia – as a manifestation of specific cultural policies. I also look at the evolving functions of ecclesiastical treasuries in Bohemian late medieval culture. I study my sources through the lens of cultural history, rather than a stylistic point of view - this has helped me to untangle the network of manifold social and cultural phenomena inherent to a treasury. In particular, I examine treasure as an intellectual construct, and its practical implementation in a medieval church treasury with its own aspects of formation, growth, function and presentation, patronage, administration, differentiation, or destruction. The study is divided in two main parts. First is a general introduction to the study of medieval Bohemian church treasuries.

It was a transmission of the cult, the formation of the source material and the way of recording, the narrative pattern as well. This transmission from the pagan practice to the Christian incubation ritual concerned the elements of the cult, that is, the cult place, the cult function (healing) and the technique of healing as well as the ritual (temple sleep) and the medium (dream). It is common to both pagan and Christian incubation practice that the sacred place was more important than the figure of the healer and both the practice of incubation was intimately linked to the healing place. In addition to the Christianisation of the practice, the way of recording it also continued. The aim of this doctoral dissertation is to trace this formation and composition of the incubation miracles as stories, individual narratives and literary shaped miracle collections.   My survey focuses on the miracles of Saint Thecla, the two versions of the miraculous cures of Saint Cosmas and Damian, that of Cyrus and John and the corpus of Saint Artemios. These collections, from the 5th  7th centuries, from the Eastern Mediterranean, together constitute a well-defined group, differing in kind from other contemporary Byzantine hagiographical records. Focusing on the narrative aspects of these sources is justified because emerging early Christian incubation adopted not only elements of the pagan ritual but when recording it, drew heavily on the ancient narrative records of temple sleep. The development and the transformation of dream cures and its textual, literary expressions ran in parallel with each other, both being rooted in the preceding cult practice. Consequently, and rather oddly, these Christian collections of dream healing bear a closer resemblance to the incubation records of antiquity than to contemporary Christian hagiographical genres (in the form of the narrative, of course, not in its theology).', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1894k)'}"

Along with nineteenth century literature published on the topic, early interest in the preserved altarpieces was mirrored by the care for them, by the fact that their restoration began at a very early date. A short overview of the sholarship and a history of the restoration attitude as it changed over the centuries is presented in the introduction of the thesis. Transylvanian altarpieces were mainly preserved in the territories inhabited by the Saxons. However, there are certain examples known from the Székely sedes, a region that remained overwhelmingly Catholic during the centuries but practically nothing was left from the retables in the region of the noble counties. A short part of the thesis deals with the historical, economic, ecclesiastical situation in these three large administrative territories naturally concentrating on their altar production and the written sources referring to this aspect. A brief characterization of the early period (fourteenth and the early fifteenth centuries) of Transylvanian winged altarpieces aims at providing an image of the very beginnings of altar production in or for Transylvania. The first significant period of Transylvanian winged altarpieces, a period from which the first large number of high quality retables has been preserved comes in the 1470s - 1480s. Although a strong foreign influence is evident, these are the first pieces which permit conclusions to be drawn on local workshop production practices versus foreign masters and also important stylistic trends in Transylvania. A group of retables from the time of King Matthias which almost exclusively characterize the period from the stylistic point of view, was selected in order to represent this era. These pieces reveal the strong influence of the Viennese Schottenmaster and his circle and are clustered in a quite narrow geographic region marked by the altarpieces of Mediasch (Mediaş, Medgyes), Grossprobstdorf (Proştea Mare, Nagyekemező), Birthälm (Biertan, Berethalom) and a wall-painting cycle from Schässburg (Sighişoara, Segesvár). Through a thorough analysis of these paintings along with the historical data related to the history of the given locality in that period, light has been shed on the circumstances under which these altarpieces came into being. The heyday of unmistakably local, Transylvanian winged altar production can clearly be grasped in the first quarter of the sixteenth century. In order to offer a glimpse into this world, one special workshop from sixteenth century Hermannstadt (Sibiu, Nagyszeben) has been selected and presented through the oeuvre of Master Vincentius.

This dissertation examines the most coherent group of works among these, those dating between about 1420 and 1520: thirty-three paintings that represent nearly all the known Sienese masters who were active during these hundred years. The chronological boundaries are those of the Sienese Quattrocento taken in a stylistic sense, and range from the activity of Sassetta, the first great master of the new style to masters like Bernardino Fungai and Girolamo di Benvenuto whose activity reaches into the Cinquecento but who never truly abandoned the artistic principles of the Quattrocento.  Since the majority of the paintings now separated in the two museums originally formed part of the private collection of Bishop Arnold Ipolyi (1823-1886)  who in turn purchased nearly all of them from the painter and restorer Johann Anton Ramboux (1790-1866)  it seemed necessary to study together the works now in Budapest and Esztergom. A smaller number of paintings belonged to a hitherto unknown Roman collector, Canon Raffaele Bertinelli (1802-1878), whose gallery was purchased by Cardinal János Simor (1813-1891), the founder of the Christian Museum. The analysis of the influences on the collecting interests of these private owners throws light on important similarities and differences between them, especially as regards their attitudes to the Nazarene movement, Romanticism, and to the rise of interest in the art of the late Middle Ages. I studied the collection history of the works in Hungary in the wider context of the reception history and historiography of early Sienese art. Sienese Quattrocento painting raised general interest among art historians only in recent decades, which brought to light a great amount of new information. The main purpose of this dissertation was to study the previously little researched works in Hungary in the light of these new results. Besides relying on the traditional methods of art history, I placed special emphasis on a methodology that too is rather recent but is indispensable for the understanding of these panel paintings that are mostly fragments of larger structures.

This success of Catholicism in this region, which was on the cost of the Eastern rite, had various reasons, which have not been articulated clearly in the historiography. In my thesis I argue that the most important one for this phenomenon is the interaction of the Holy See with the local nobility through the political structure of the Regnum Albaniae. Regnum Albaniae, a political structure created in the seventies of the thirteenth century by Charles I of Anjou, was studied only as a negative phenomenon for the Albanians and its interaction with the locals was only seen in a negative light and simplified into a relation between occupiers and occupied. In this study, I try to shed light on the positive role of the Regnum Albaniae especially for the establishing of an identity of the local nobility, for the implementation of the papal plans in the Southwestern Balkans and as a result, for the flourishing of Catholicism in the region. Through the correspondence of the Holy See with the representatives of the Regnum Albaniae, the local nobles of the Southwestern Balkans realized that the Regnum Albaniae was considered an important political power in the Balkans from the pontifical point of view, a power upon which the Papal Curia relied. In this context, Regnum Albaniae represented a source of power, identification and self-representation for the local nobility as required. Catholicism was one of the key ideologies that connected the political and religious visions of the Avignon Popes and the local nobility of the Regnum Albaniae in the fourteenth century. While the Avignon Popes saw it as a means of religious and political outreach in the Balkans, the local nobility considered it a political means to connect with the West and reap power benefits by association. At this moment of apparent triumph, the French religious influence in the region was quite strong. Supported by both the Holy See and the local nobility, the number of Catholic religious houses and clergy increased, and the territories of the nobles who considered themselves members of the Regnum Albaniae became true strongholds of Catholicism against the Orthodox rite in the area. The religious and political visions of the Avignon popes and of the local members of the Regnum Albaniae were again united on the eve of their almost simultaneous downfalls.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3190k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Once he returned to Hungary, he put down the foundations of one of the greatest book collections in Hungary of his time. Batthyány had a passion for plants as well as a deep interest in the “secrets of nature,” and alchemical experimentation remained a hobby which accompanied him throughout his entire life.  I attempted to develop a parallel story of an individual and the age he lived in. While writing the biography of Boldizsár Batthyány, I approached the question of what the main trends in science in the sixteenth century and the Count’s personal involvement were in scientific activities.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (7389k)'}"

As a response the Swedish government, led by the Social Democrats, drastically shifted the Swedish asylum- and refugee policy from one of the most generous and open, to one only complying with EU minimum standards. This thesis sets out to explore how the Refugee Crisis of 2015, and the restrictive U-turn in Swedish asylum policies, are debated, negotiated and justified within the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP). The research interest is primarily inspired by Keith Banting and Will Kymlickaâ€™s (2017) recent elaborations on the political sources of solidarity in diverse societies and focuses on the important role of political actors in promoting inclusive solidarity. The restrictive policy shift has not passed uncontested and a divide has emerged within the party on immigration. By looking into the box and analyzing the internal party debates I hope to contribute with valuable insights in how a central progressive political actor is negotiating the notion of solidarity, as well as, the notion of a possible progressive dilemma. One of the clearest findings in the discourse analysis of the 2017 Social Democratic congress debate show an ongoing crisis of solidarity within the party and a struggle over the understanding of what solidarity entails when it comes to migration policies.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (982k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Thus, it proposes that, in the context of globalization, the processes of diffusion and adaptation should be taken into consideration in regard to the emergence of populist units across different cultural, historical and political contexts. In doing so, the thesis follows the national-populism framework and deploys a transnational approach in order to demonstrate how and in which circumstances the ‘success’ of national-populist politics elsewhere can influence the emergence of embryonic populist units in other, socio-culturally different national contexts and how the adaptation of exclusionary discourses is taking place. The research questions are addressed via examining the recently emerged social movement in Georgia- Georgian March. In order to track the process of diffusion and explain it, the thesis draws upon the methodological framework from Social Movement Studies and combines it with the Historical-Discourse Analysis approach. Analytically, three main discursive fields of immigration, “foreign influence” and family and Christian values are outlined. The main tool for empirically approaching the theoretical assumption is an analysis of the movement’s discourses and incorporation of the West in it. The following key findings highlight hierarchical and proximity models of diffusion and sum up as follows: Firstly, the movement constructs a “double face” of Europe through which a ‘progressive’ image of the West is positioned for legitimizing their national-populist discourses albeit with subtly endorsing traditional right-wing anti-Western discourses; Secondly, not only do the discourse fields resemble other national-populist cases, but also discursive strategies, practices, and even exact phrases are copied from them; Lastly, considering intentional avoidance of associating with Russia, the strategic adaptation is central to the diffusion process in this case and indicates the front stage populist logic of Georgian March.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2375k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This has been followed by 18 years of a peace process that was designed to move the politics of the province past its deep ethnonational divide but instead has seen the steady rise of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, exclusive nationalist parties. This polarisation towards the radical ideological poles has accelerated in both post-Brexit referendum elections of 2017.

The dominant approach to studying Northern Ireland presently is through the debate on consociational power-sharing as a prescription for a divided society. This study proposes to surmount the question of polarisation using a historic institutionalism approach that conceptualises both the Belfast Agreement and the Brexit referendum as critical junctures.

In this operationalization of nationalist sentiments, elites have reinvented and framed common political discourses to advance a ‘unified’ understanding of what constitutes ‘us’ and ‘them’. This nationalist stronghold has permeated the discourses on immigration, foreign policy and even social welfare in the U.S. Similarly, Europe has seen nationalism take hold in the wake of the 2015 ‘refugee crisis’, with immigration narratives largely centered on the threat of Islam and the political and social instability thereafter of Europe. This thesis attempts to look at another narrative which has been instrumental for nationalist—more specifically religious-nationalist— claim making in European and American elite discourses, Christian persecution.

For the bottom-up perspective, I assume an insider ethnographic position following the local and international network of two Italian NGOs involved in the Program. I analyze the results of three group discussions conducted with beneficiaries of the Program and examine the importance of non-formal education and interculturality in their European identification.

Although the literature has given substantial attention to the former two, there is a lack of nuanced discussion on the latter. Furthermore, the field has mostly sought to answer these normative questions from a purely theoretical perspective. Since the question of what is owed to refugees after admission relies on the question of what enables newcomers to best join existing societies, empirical field research can be helpful. Accordingly, employing original field research interviewing refugees in Budapest and Malmö, I conduct a comparative analysis of their experiences in terms of why they chose to stay, what they think of life there, and what their future plans are. I find that interpersonal embeddedness in the life of the city, personal connections to locals, and activities that furnish meaning and purpose are critical after resettlement. Putting this in conversation with the theoretical normative literature on what is owed after admission, I identify several problematic areas. By critiquing the prevailing theories, and highlighting Goodin’s neglected theory in the field that argues that the boundaries around people are what matter morally, I provide a pathway forward.

This approach neglects the significant role of citizenship as national membership on individual understanding of ordinary citizens and their everyday practices.

By 2016, with announcement of the exceptional citizenship proposal as a plan to naturalize Syrian refugees which met with a strong backlash, the focus of the scholars has shifted in Turkey from minorities to non-citizens –namely, refugees. With this shift, Turkish citizenship has defined and practiced for the first time through outsiders who are non-citizens. Within the frame of this context, this thesis aims to examine the discursive construction of exclusion through citizenship in Turkey and to investigate the citizenship perception of citizens by adopting a people-centered, micro-level approach. By analyzing the party discourses, social media contents and interviews with 10 shopkeepers, this thesis demonstrates that the presence of the refugees has a renationalizing effect on citizenship by coupling it with national identity and it also reveals that citizenship perception of Turkish citizens is based on a combination of weak territorial membership and strong blood-based membership.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1130k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In order to investigate this identity perception and the common loyalty of Ottoman Greeks, discourse and content analysis of two leading periodicals of that time, Konstantinoupolis and Thraki, were employed.

Therefore, direct contact does not indicate prejudice reduction among Macedonian players. In addition, no intersectionality in prejudice is found due to higher negative inclinations towards the ethnic identity of the Albanian players i.e. their religious belonging does not affect the attitudes of Macedonian players.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1289k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I will analyze two different civilizational arguments that were used for securitization of migrant crisis in 2015 and have framed miass migration as the threat to European identity. Based on the analysis, I formulate my main hypothesis that the anti-immigrant discourse is the expression of certain form of Pan-European nationalism. In the first chapter of the thesis I will set up the theoretical background and explain the methodology that I will be using, while the second chapter will start with a historical overview of how Europe was conceptualized in the civilizational terms based on its unique culture and tradition. In the second part of this chapter I will make my remarks on different conceptions of European identity from the contemporary perspective. The third chapter consists of brief introduction to transnational populism and civilizationism as the main elements of the anti immigrant mobilization. The main analysis is conducted in chapter four, were I will deconstruct two different types of arguments for anti-immigrant mobilization. The first one that I refer to as the Christian argument is found in the discourse of Viktor Orban who opposes Islam based on its supposed incompatibility with traditional Christian values. On the other hand, secular argument that Wilders uses is based on the commitment to secular ideas and perception that Islam is incompatible with Western liberal values. In conclusion, I will try to answer the more ambitious question: how the anti-immigrant mobilization affects European solidarity and identification with Europe as the common culture? The aim to show that advocates of civilizationist arguments are interpreting those threats as the potential danger primarily to European collective identity, which is contained within their separate national identities. Even when populist anti-immigrant parties ii  claim that they are protecting their own national identities, they are putting it in the context of broader civilizational discourse in which the Muslim Other is a threat to Europe as a whole.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (769k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I look at the identity formation processes of Peruvians with ethnic Japanese background in light of the strong attachment to Japan as an imagined homeland, the troubled history of anti-Japanese discrimination in Peru and US internment of Japanese Peruvians during World War II, the consolidation of Japanese as a high-status minority, and ethnic return migration to Japan from 1990. Ethnicity has been assumed to be the cornerstone of identity in both Latin America where high sensitivity for racial differences results in intergenerational categorization and Japan where the essence of Japaneseness is assumed to run through one’s veins and passed on to further generations even if they were born and raised abroad. However when ethnic returnees arrived to Japan they had to realize that they were not Japanese by Japanese standards and chose to redefine themselves, in the case of Japanese Peruvians as Nikkei. I aim to explore the contents of the Japanese Peruvian definition of Nikkei by looking at existing literature and conducting video interviews through Skype and Messenger with third- and fourth-generation Japanese Peruvians. I look into what are their personal experiences as Nikkei, what changes do they recognize as the consequence of ethnic return migration, whether ethnicity has remained the most relevant in forming social relations, and what do they think about Japan now that return migration is virtually ended and the visa that allowed preferential access to Japanese descendants is not likely to be extended to further generations. Assimilation and transnational migration theories generally imply that immigrants eventually integrate and assimilate and Japanese Peruvians certainly did, yet they still strongly identify with their ethnic roots. As a result they developed a hybrid identity that incorporates both having Japanese heritage and being Peruvian, also because after four generations the majority of Japanese descendants are ethnically mixed.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (778k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Nevertheless, we know less about who radical right parties actually compete for votes with and what differentiates their voter base from these competitors' voter base.

I ask two questions: First, does the political competition differ for radical right parties when they compete for votes with (a) center- right and (b) leftist parties.

By focusing on this event, the thesis contributes to the wider debates related to the symbolic potential that the myth of Kosovo carries for this generation and its impact on collective memory in regards to the 1990s in Serbia. Theoretical framework of the dissertation is based on conceptual discussion in four subject areas: collective memory, sociological generations, cultural trauma and national myths. Empirical data is collected by an online survey (N=175) of respondents from the age cohort born between 1990-1997.

Seen as something that cannot and should not be compromised, gender equality is often instrumentalized for different political agendas. While major scholarly work on the instrumentalization of women's rights for political purposes has focused on countries of Western Europe and argued that women's rights are usually used as an alibi for Islamophobia and anti-immigrant campaigns, not much literature has been written on the phenomenon outside of Western Europe. This thesis aims to fill that gap by looking at Serbia, an EU candidate country, and the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Based on the discourse analysis of the ruling party's officials, this thesis argues that the party has used women's rights as a tool for reaching its own political goals. The findings of the thesis suggest that these goals can be divided into two thematic units: the first one refers to the SNS officials' instrumentalization of discourse about gender equality in the EU accession process; the second one shows that the rhetoric about women's rights is an inseparable part of the SNS' comprehensive populist strategy of stigmatizing its political opponents with the aim of gaining support from the electorate. The findings imply that the ruling SNS invokes women's rights strategically – when it contributes to its political agenda – but fails to address structural problems related to gender equality and domestic violence on other occasions."", 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (714k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Through multi-sited ethnography following the transnational networks between Bistrița-Năsăud county, Romania, southern Spain, and Vienna, Austria, I test this assumption by investigating how circular and return migrants from rural Transylvania judge the “development” of their communities after three decades of “transition” and migration. I argue that the things they bring back (their “social and economic remittances”; Levitt 1998) paint a mixed picture of “European integration,” as villagers embrace both positive and negative ideas from the “West” while also rejecting or reinterpreting others. Applying Garapich and Grabowska’s (2016) processual typology of remittances (“imitation, resistance, and innovation”), I show how acts of imitating the West (ranging from the adoption of “modern” infrastructure to embracing norms about entrepreneurship, professionalism, and racial hierarchies) are countered by attempts to resist Western values in favor of “traditional Romanian” (or rural, religious, and peasant) lifestyles. I argue that villagers recast this backward-looking romanticization of pre-socialist history into forward-oriented strategies of getting by and finding pride in their peripheralized region by vernacularizing Western concepts to transform ancestral practices (like peasant farming) into modern amenities (like organic agriculture). These findings, which emphasize how “transnationalism and nationalism, or globalizing and localizing processes,...shape one another both simultaneously and sequentially” (Verdery 1998, 292), sometimes contradict earlier studies of middle-class migrants in different Western cities and thus imply the need for more research into the ways social class, religious socialization, and sending-and-receiving- locality dynamics affect the transfer of ideas back and forth across the continent.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1396k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The research questions are: How are democratic regimes in plural societies articulated? Which dimensions can grasp the institutional varieties and practical performances of political regimes in ethnically divided democracies? What is the effect of majoritarian institutions in plural democracies, in terms of ethnic inclusion and exclusion? Accordingly, I shall map 47 plural democracies through 18 variables along 2 institutional dimensions: (i) majoritarianism or power-sharing in the government, parliament and electoral system and (ii) the territorial articulation of power. I shall then add another dimension on (iii) regime quality related to group relations: ethnic inclusion or exclusion. This framework, coupling de jure institutions with de facto performances, proves that: (i) power-sharing democracy is associated with ethnic inclusion; nonetheless (ii) majoritarian democracy occurs in plural societies and can coexist with ethnic inclusion. A simple quantitative analysis is insufficient to explain this pattern. I will thence conduct a most similar comparison of 2 majoritarian democracies of my sample – Turkey (majoritarian/exclusive) and Mali (majoritarian/inclusive) – to confirm that: (i) majoritarian institutions in plural societies often lead to ethnic exclusion, albeit (ii) this scenario can be avoided when exogenous factors are at play (party system, political culture/tradition of accommodation). However, as the diachronic analysis will show, these factors remain precarious and (iii) majoritarian institutions, in particular the centralization of power, are demonstrated to be ill-suited to deal with territorially concentrated minorities.

This thesis is an investigation of its effects on the growing rifts within the Christian Democratic party family.

The response and claims being made by these parties will be historically, institutionally, and politically contextualized. In order to do so I will utilize the discourse historical approach of critical discourse analysis and process tracing. In light of this analysis, I argue that the Hungarian Fidesz party, with Orbán at its helm, has engaged in the social creativity strategy of identity management and created a new claim on Christian Democracy. This claim combines nationalism, populism, and civilizationism, wherein the “Christian” component of Christian Democracy is central. The German Christian Democratic Union, headed by Angela Merkel has made no such grand ideological claims but rather has been characterized by caution, pragmatism and centrism. Even while refusing to backdown rhetorically from a defense of the rights of asylum seekers and the responsibility of Germany, and the EU more broadly, to help, their policy making reflected collaboration, cooperation, and concession on these principles. The Austrian People’s Party engages in both approaches, fluctuating between the two without overindulging in either.

As an attempt to fill this scholarly void, this research, with the empirical case of Pashtun Tahafuz (protection) Movement (PTM) of Pakistan, seeks to explore how social movements operate in peculiar hybrid regimes like Pakistan. The study employs 10 semi-structured qualitative Skype interviews with PTM and other smaller movements’ activists to understand the relationship between mobilization and repression in Pakistan and discover movement’s possible outcomes under such a regime type. The research finds that dual (emanating from both the military and political organs of the state) and haphazard repression by a hybrid regime, characterized by the dominance of military and limited political opportunity structure, can curtail the social movement mobilization in the short run, but fails to cease the movement.

The question is raised in this paper on why the state not a homogenous actor itself remains passive vis-Ã\xa0-vis Stalin State Museum while the concept and the structure of the Restored Museum of Avlabari Underground Printing House will soon be revisited. Through interviews, ethnographic observation and the analysis of the preliminary concepts on the future of Stalin State Museum the following conclusions were drawn: state actors variously appropriate arguments on the necessity to (re)contextualize the exhibition in order to protract the transformation of the space and to keep the site as an important landmark of Gori. At the Museum administration and the ordinary staff level these visions are further reappropriated in the complex internal process of meaning making. Due to its different function and modes of representation, Avlabari Underground Printing House Museum is a historical but a nationally void place in contrast to the Stalin State Museum. Therefore, it now needs to be transformed into the true site of national memory telling the progressive history of typography in Georgia.

In the framework of the present paper, the aim is to highlight the use of κατά τόν λόγον which appears in the first lines of the chapter I.7 of Aristotle’s Meteorology, by focusing upon two philosophical questions: one ontological (what is the ontological status of obscure phenomena?) and one epistemological (can we come to the knowledge of such phenomena, and if so, in which way?). Aristotle proposes two answers for these questions in the text, respectively: The meteora (and therefore the comets discussed in chapter I.7 of Meteorology) are natural entities. However, phenomena discussed in Meteorology, although particulars, cannot be fully observed by the senses. Also, one can come to the knowledge of them by giving a reasonable account (κατά τόν λόγον) which requires the use of analogy. I will show that Aristotle, indeed, places comets in the sublunar world and that the reasonable account ― which include an analogy ― is of epistemic value. Such arguments are not justification arguments; however, rather they are a part of Aristotle’s method of discovery, and they serve as something more than an explanation and/or illustration. I am confident that this reasonable account lies in the context of a ‘heuristic process’. I will show that when it comes to justification in terms of a ‘correctness’ of a theory Aristotle turns to empirical observations, since we cannot speak of justifying something that is so prone to error as phenomena hidden from our senses, such as comets, are.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (829k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This involves taking note of: the global sceptic’s challenge, G. E. Moore’s project of defending common sense and Norman Malcolm’s argument against Moore’s project. In chapter 2, I present two lines of attack based on Wittgenstein’s remarks: the first aims at undermining the kinds of philosophical doubts that constitute the global sceptic’s challenge; the second has as its target Moore’s strategy of defending common sense in the face of the challenge posed by idealist philosophers. In chapter 3, I discuss the proposals that Wittgenstein explores in response to the problem of characterization of Moore-like propositions. I argue against interpretations of Wittgenstein’s remarks, put forth by Malcolm, Stroll and Moyal-Sharrock, which suggest that Moore-like propositions are objectively certain for us. Next, I argue against the use of the concept of objective certainty, as Moyal-Sharrock understands it, to characterize Moore-like propositions; instead, I suggest that the logical exclusion of mistake and the inconceivability of doubt most appropriately characterize them.  Although this short thesis is far from exhaustive not only in discussing all the main issues that occupy Wittgenstein in On Certainty, but also in exploring the issues that it does discuss in part, I hope that a general picture of Wittgenstein’s approach to some of the perennial questions of epistemology begins to emerge from it.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (880k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

If yes, what are the consequences for epistemology, philosophy of perception and the philosophy of mind? The main proposal of my dissertation is that if the answer to the first question is positive, then we obtain very significant consequences in the cited domains. In particular, I’ll focus on the hypothesis that mental imagery plays a constitutive role in amodal completion to show that significant results can be obtained in the debate about the cognitive penetrability of perception and epistemic justification; disjunctivism and the nature of hallucinations; and, finally, representationalism and perceptual content. Thus, I attempt to do fourth things. First, I argue that explanations of the epistemological problem of cognitive penetrability that blame mental imagery lead to a dilemma about perceptual justification.

Arguing for creationism, Ikhwan al-Safa employ the Neoplatonic emanation theory as it is developed in their tenth-century Arabic encyclopedia. However, some historians have claimed that Ikhwan al-Safa’s emanation theory is a veiled attack on creationism that embraces the Aristotelian doctrine of the world’s eternity. Ikhwan al-Safa’s philosophical project is thus characterized as a project that aims either to reconcile or propagate a presupposed conflict between philosophy and religion, expressed for instance in this tension between Aristotelianism and creationism. This characterization allegedly lurks behind opposing historical testimonies regarding Ikhwan al-Safa’s identity and doctrine which I claim is contemporarily reproduced in similar terms with Ikhwan al-Safa’s scholarship. While both historical and contemporary characterizations tempt a double reading approach to Ikhwan al-Safa’s philosophy, I consider their philosophical project within the tradition of early Arabic philosophy, whose enterprise can be characterized as a natural theology project which does not presuppose a conflict between philosophy and religion. While Ikhwan al-Safa identify the philosophical tension between creationism and the world’s eternity doctrine, I demonstrate that Ikhwan al-Safa use emanation theory rather to substantiate their creationist arguments in light of their overall identification of creation with emanation. Consequently, Ikhwan al-Safa’s reception of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic sources should be recognized as a particular philosophical synthesis of both with creationism, for they did not merely transmit these sources, but assimilated them into the Islamic context of 10th century Iraq.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1304k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

First of all, this is achieved by stressing his influence on Proclus on the one hand and Pseudo-Dionysius on the other. Therefore, the thesis suggests, that in the Athenian philosophical school Christian Neoplatonist philosophers, such as Synesius were indeed read and discussed. The suggestion continues that it was under Proclus that the author of Dionysian corpus got acquainted with Synesius’ writings. But while Proclus was probably ignoring the Christian tenet of Synesius’ philosophy, Ps.-Dionysius held this very nature of Synesius’ thought the most important to “Christianize Proclus”, in other words to construct his own Christian metaphysical system to match it with the pagan counterpart. Thus, in the first chapter of the thesis, I stress the influence of Synesius’ hymns on Proclus’ hymns and Ps.-Dionysius’ letters. The second and third chapter of the thesis intends to further emphasize the uniqueness of Synesius’ thought. It starts with the rethinking of Theiler’s and Hadot’s thesis on Christian Platonist philosophers, who were denying the originality of their thought by making them dependent on Porphyry, the student of Plotinus. In the third chapter, I try to reconstruct the metaphysics of Synesius’ hymns concentrating on the anthropology of the hymns that I argue to be Christocentric in its nature. This is again in order to emphasize the uniqueness of Synesius’ hymns and to stress the novelties that he introduced in Christian and Neoplatonist philosophy in general. In the appendices I provide my own translation of the nine hymns of Synesius with some notes and remarks in the footnotes. There I also present my translation of the hymn Ὦ πάντων ἐπέκεινα (O, the One who is beyond all), that was attributed to Ps.-Dionysius by Martin Sicherl. Appendices end with my research on the mentioned hymn. In that chapter one can observe how Synesius’ hymns are echoed in the Dionysian hymn and it makes the attribution of the hymn to the authorship of Ps.-Dionysius even more credible.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (803k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Contrary to the extreme positions of historical determinism (full necessity) and antideterminism (full contingency), I argue that history is somewhat necessary and somewhat contingent, meaning that some historical events are necessary or close to necessity, while others are contingent or close to contingency. To do that, I start with covering the theory of historical counterfactual events and how to construct them. Then I deal with notions of necessity and overdetermination of events, paying special attention to how close overdetermination of events comes to necessity and whether it can be an argument for historical determinism. Finally, I argue for the connection between overdetermination of events and how specific the description of an event is, while the specificity depends on how much evidence we have to support the description. When there is little evidence to support a single description, underdetermination by evidence happens. I investigate what underdetermination by evidence means for overdetermination of events, counterfactual events and for the overall distinction between necessity and contingency, determinism and antideterminism. The result of my investigation is that history, which holds some uncertainty due to underdetermination by evidence, is neither fully necessary nor fully contingent.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (522k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

To extend knowledge assignment to even more cases of statistical evidence, I apply a famous distinction from Wilfrid Sellars between ‘manifest image’ and ‘scientific image’ of the world and ourselves to the case of knowledge; I enumerate some of the problems with the intuitive notion of knowledge, discuss some historical considerations to better understand such intuitive reactions and, briefly, explore the possibility of a move towards a more scientific notion of knowledge which not only allows knowledge assignment to many cases with statistical evidence but also can help with addressing some long-lasting issues in epistemology.  Then, I turn to a parallel issue with statistical evidence in the context of legal cases. Discussing three proposals to distinguish the non-statistical and statistical evidence, I argue that none of them manages to provide an independent rationale for such discrimination.  Finally, I address some worries about the reliability of the current statistical methods that are used to produce statistical evidence as well as some concerns regarding the applicability of statistical methods to particular cases and propose some criteria that can help to decide whether a piece of statistical evidence is relevant and can be used as a basis for judgment in each scenario.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (728k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I argue that doing participant observation involves taking a position from which one can observe the “micro-context” of action. This type of observation and the consequent knowledge acquired enables producing reliable interpretations. However, this production also relies on mind-reading, that is, the psychological capacity to ascribe mental states to others. I argue that first participant observation enables to better “mind-read” the members of the community studied, and second, recruiting mind-reading in participant observation enables the ethnographer to recover the meaning of human actions in terms of their mental causes.

Using a central principle of this theory, I claim that the mind extends, not only into the physical environment, but socially as well. This socially extended mind provides the basis of group mental states, which function similarly to those of individual human minds, specifically as distributed cognitive systems.

Since voluntarism is primarily a view about the divine nature, emphasising the conceptual and metaphysical priority of God's will over his intellect, first—in chapter 2—I turn to Berkeley’s theological views, trying to show that his standpoint on the divine attributes and the proper language we are to use to characterize God is best interpreted as voluntarist. Granted that Berkeley indeed speaks about the divine psychology, especially about the first person of the Trinity, like a theological voluntarist it is still essential to ask whether his theology is reflected in his views on the created world, the laws of nature and how science should be conducted. Accordingly, I will investigate—in chapter 3—Berkeley’s positive views on the physical world, and argue that his philosophy of nature, emphasizing the contingency of the laws of nature, goes further in a characteristically voluntarist vein than is minimally required or trivially implied by his immaterialist metaphysics. The last stage of my interpretation—chapter 4—concerns the highly controversial issue as to the role the divine archetypes fulfil in Berkeley’s system. My chief objective in this part is to show that Berkeley’s take on archetypes, despite all the interpretations suggesting the contrary opinion, not only fits with a voluntarist interpretation of his philosophy, but in fact reveals his deep commitment to anti-intellectualism."", 'Access': 'Degree: PhD'}"

The issue of coordination is a classic epistemic problem concerning how we justify our use of abstract conceptual tools to represent concrete phenomena. For instance, how could we get to represent universal gravitation as a mathematical formula or temperature by means of a numerical scale? This problem is particularly pressing when justification for using these abstract tools comes, in part or entirely, from knowledge which is not independent from them, thus leading to threats of circularity. Achieving coordination between some abstract conceptual tools and the concrete phenomena that they are supposed to represent is usually a complex process, which involves several epistemic components. Some of these components eventually provide stable conditions for applying those abstract representations to concrete phenomena. It is in this sense of providing certain conditions of applicability that different philosophical traditions, as well as some contemporary reappraisals, view these components as constitutive or a priori. In this work, I present a new gradualist, contextualist, and relational approach to understand these constitutive components of scientific inquiry. It is gradualist inasmuch as the degree to which some component is constitutive depends on three quantifiable features: quasi-axiomaticity, generative potential, and empirical shielding. Since the quantification of these three features impinges on the history and practice of using these components in a scientific context, my approach is a contextualist one. Finally, my approach is relational in a double sense: first, it identifies ordinal relationships among epistemic components with respect to their constitutive character; second, these relationships are relative to a scientific framework of inquiry. After introducing my account and a classic example of constitutively a priori principles, i.e., Friedman’s (2001) analysis of Newtonian mechanics, I turn to my own case studies to demonstrate the advantages of my approach. Firstly, I discuss Okasha’s (2018) view of endogenization as a pervasive theoretical strategy in evolutionary biology and suggest that the constitutive character of the core Darwinian principles progressively increases with endogenization. Secondly, I apply a conceptual distinction between two varieties or scopes of coordination – general coordination and coordination in measurement – to Ohm’s work on electrical conductivity. This distinction allows me to pinpoint to what extent components along different dimensions (e.g., instrumentation, measurement, theorising, etc.) were constitutive of the forms of coordination which Ohm relied on. Thirdly, I discuss the epistemic function of the Hardy-Weinberg principle in the history and practice of population genetics. I assess this principle in terms of my account and identify approximation and stability as two components that are highly constitutive, in that they contribute to justifying its use in population genetics. Finally, applying my account to these case studies enables me to identify at least three qualitatively different types of constitutive components: domain-specific theoretical principles, material components, and domain-independent assumptions underlying reasoning abilities. In the light of my results, I draw some general conclusions on epistemic justification and scientific knowledge.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2174k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

In order to defend this claim, I rely on the intrinsic value of personhood, autonomy, and the capacity for well-being, and the resulting account is meant to appeal both to scholars sympathetic to Kant's moral theory and those skeptical of it. I begin by rebutting two classical objections to the idea of duties to oneself. First, I consider the charge that the notion of a duty to oneself is self-contradictory. In response, I argue that the explanation of why we can release others from their duties to us at will lends no support to the claim that we can release ourselves from duties to ourselves in a similar way. Instead, the moral justification for releasing oneself from a duty to oneself derives from the value and significance autonomy, and thus requires us to act consistently with it. Second, I examine the objection that, since morality is essentially social, purely self-regarding actions fall outside of moral realm. In response, I argue that this objection would rule out the possibility of genuinely moral duties to oneself only on the presupposition that it provides a definition of morality. Such a definition, however, cannot be established prior to a substantive first-order moral inquiry. Additionally, I address the skepticism stemming from the connection between wrongdoing and blame and argue that, while we have the standing to blame the person who treats herself badly, the importance of personal growth and of self-trust renders the expression of our blame inappropriate. My argument is then further developed by critically engaging with two arguments for duties to oneself. First, I consider and reject Kant’s argument on account of its being too closely tied to a single aspect of our rational nature, namely, our capacity for moral reasoning. I suggest instead that a plausible view of persons’ value is hybrid which among other factors includes persons’ capacity to form emotional ties and to autonomously set up and pursue meaningful goals. Second, I examine a recent attempt by Paul Schofield to ground duties to oneself by relying on Stephen Darwall’s second-personal framework of morality. I argue that this view is ultimately unsuccessful, because it is phenomenologically suspect, it is vulnerable to an intra-personal version of the non-identity problem, and it cannot provide a plausible account for choosing between a course of action that will result in greater aggregate benefit of a cluster of perspectives and another course of action that will produce greater benefit per perspective. Having cleared the ground for my own proposal, I argue that the value we have as persons grounds two standing duties to ourselves: the duty of self-respect and the duty of well-being. I focus on the duty of well-being and show that the duty of care for the well-being of others is importantly different from the duty of well-being that we owe to ourselves. The nature of persons’ well-being is such that it is partly up to the agent herself to realize it. Given the intrinsic value of persons and given the critical relation between person’s well-being and her autonomy, I conclude that we have a duty to strive to realize our well-being and that those who fail at it, fail morally."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1498k)'}"

In the early Stoic framework, natural bodies are a class of entities that comprise discrete natural materials, plants, animals and humans. These entities are special parts of the cosmos: they are unified and qualified by pneuma, the cosmic principle of life. While the constitution, behaviour and development of natural bodies are discussed in great detail in accounts of natural philosophy and ethics, the metaphysical accounts related to the existence and changes of these bodies is not elaborated in detail. In this work I aim at reconstructing a unified theory of the qualification, unity and identity of natural bodies by examining various tenets of early Stoic philosophy. Looking at the problems of synchronic and diachronic identity, unity, ontogenesis and the corporeality of metaphysical principles, I argue that while there are a great number of texts that testify to an effort to provide a coherent, elaborate and innovative account of the ontology of natural bodies, this project never went beyond hinting at a possible theory. Combined with the tenets of the two principles and the four categories, the early Stoic accounts of identity and ontogenesis clearly point towards a top-down ontology that construes natural bodies as compounds of unqualified matter and a self-moving form-like principle (the logos) that accounts for the unity, qualification, identity and motions of bodies. This theory could provide a coherent, corporealist account of the metaphysics of natural bodies, and would be in concordance with the physical and ethical theory. However, as it becomes clear during the discussions of distinct problems of metaphysics and natural philosophy in each chapter, there is just as much evidence for a diametrically opposed theory that accounts for qualification, identity and even unity in a bottom-up way, by taking three-dimensional, solid, material bodies as simple and metaphysically fundamental entities. I conclude that the coexistence of these two accounts makes it impossible to offer a coherent reconstruction of Stoic metaphysics and testifies to the Stoic disinterest in a unified and theoretically homogeneous metaphysical theory.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2319k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The LCM posited a global account of levels according to which every object of scientific inquiry could be placed into a single hierarchical structure; with the organisation of scientific inquiry reflecting the very same hierarchical structure. Whilst this is arguably a well-known organisational structure for scientific inquiry and the world it investigates, it has long since been widely rejected as playing any significant role in contemporary scientific practice or reflecting the organisation of our scientific inquiries (Brooks, 2016; Feibleman, 1954; Guttman, 1976; Potochnik and McGill, 2012; Waters, 2008). A central theme within discussions of levels of organisation has concerned whether the concept has outlived its utility both in scientific practice and the philosophical analysis of it (DiFrisco, 2016; Eronen, 2013, 2015), or whether the concept can still serve to illustrate an important aspect of scientific practice in a very different form to the LCM (Brooks, 2017; Craver, 2015; Kaiser, 2015). In this dissertation I provide a new pluralistic analysis of levels of organisation with the aim of demonstrating the concept’s centrality to many forms of scientific practice and its role as a fruitful component in analyses of those practices. My account proposes that levels of organisation are collections of purpose-relative vertical and horizontal principles deployed as representative tools in the conceptualisation of a target system of inquiry. Further, I argue that, understood this way, the concept of levels of organisation serves as a lens through which to analyse key epistemic practices, specifically the manipulation, integration, and transfer of information of, and between, systems of inquiry. In the process of developing and defending my account, I examine the use of levels across a wide-range of cutting-edge research in the life sciences, including the Human Microbiome Project, cancer research, homeostatic processes of the human digestive system, and protein signalling networks. I argue that the plausibility of my account is evidenced in these diverse research fields and also demonstrate how levels of organisation can serve as a conceptual tool with which to illuminate key aspects of the dynamic and complex processes of knowledge production in the sciences.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2115k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The converse is surely true: we often come to believe and desire what we do on the basis of what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell. Might perception be informed by cognition in a similarly specific and direct manner? In particular, might cognition influence perceptual experience in a way that sustains some semantic or logical or rational coherence between the source cognitive content and the resultant perceptual content, whereby this influence is not mediated by changes in the stimuli, the state of the sense organs, or the allocation of attention? If the answer is yes, then perception is cognitively penetrable. Assumedly, this would have interesting theoretical implications regarding mental architecture (philosophy of mind and psychology), the justificatory role of perception (epistemology), and the theory-ladenness of observation (philosophy of science).  The central thesis of this dissertation is that, a trending view in philosophy and psychology to the contrary notwithstanding, there is in fact little reason to assume that perceptual experience of low-level features such as color or lightness is cognitively penetrable. It is not claimed outright that such an effect is empirically impossible. But it is argued that the prima facie best evidence and the arguments that build on them fall short of providing a convincing case for cognitive penetrability. So the burden is on defenders of the view to explain why anyone should still entertain that the posited kind of influence actually occurs.  Closely connected to the negative thesis regarding cognitive penetrability are two positive theses. One is that cognitively impenetrable perceptual processing is plausibly richer than is commonly assumed. It is argued in particular that intra-perceptual form-lightness associations and lightness contrast may explain away an apparent lexical effect that has been most widely proposed as a prime candidate of cognitive penetration.  The second positive thesis is that some of the best candidates of cognitive penetration may be better explained by changes in affect than by changes in perception or perceptual belief. It is argued in particular that even if the phenomenon of (hypnotically) suggested hallucination is not a sham, it still doesn’t follow that subjects experience genuine perceptual hallucination or cognitive delusion. More plausibly, just as suggested analgesia may involve a dissociation between the sensory and affective components of pain, it only feels to subjects as if the suggested perceptual state of affairs really pertained.  The dissertation thus defends cognitive impenetrability of perceptual experience while expanding on both the intra-perceptual and the extra-perceptual. The intra-perceptual account carries special weight insofar as it underscores the philosophical relevance of cognitively impenetrable perceptual processes. The importance of the extra-perceptual account is that it exposes as false a dichotomy according to which all candidate effects are either perceptually or cognitively mediated. Thus, in addition to the general conclusion that cognitive penetrability of perception is empirically implausible, a crucial implication of the dissertation is that the very dialectic of the cognitive-penetrability debate itself requires mending.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2054k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

I support the reading of these two specific arguments as a coherent continuum: how the being of one was conceived by Plato as necessarily different from one, differentiating thus himself from Eleatic philosophy and setting the grounds for multiplicity, which leads Plato into a discussion on the primordial of numbers. There are numbers (the mathematical argument) only because one and being can be separated (the ontological argument).

For Aristotle phantasia is a motion of the perceptive soul that makes possible a great amount of activities and higher cognitions beyond sense-perception. Phantasia became a fundamental psychological concept in the Hellenistic Era: in empiricist epistemology, in action theory as perceptual representation of the external world; in aesthetics as creative imagination. I argue that Alexander proceeds from an Aristotelian framework of parts and capacities of the soul, but unlike Aristotle, he distinguishes a distinct capacity for phantasia. The main reason for this comes from his polemic against the Stoics: they do not acknowledge an activity of phantasia. A distinct activity requires a distinct object, which in turn a distinct capacity. The distinct status of a phantasia-capacity in itself modifies the architecture of the soul in comparison with Aristotle. But in addition Alexander makes important changes in the framework: he makes capacities as basic (and rather modular), and parts and the soul as sets of capacities. The object of phantasia is the residue from perception in activity. The status of this as internal object needs clarification. I show that it is internal on account of being a physical process in the body. Again, I argue that it is the causal object of phantasia: it is the item that provides content to the phantasia-activity by triggering it. But the residue is not an intentional object: it is a representation of something else. I give a reconstruction of Alexander`s account how the residue may be representation. Accordingly, it is a representation in virtue of preserving fully a perceptual content (something that had been perceived); or in virtue of functioning as an equivalent of a fully preserved residue insofar as phantasia completed an incompletely preserved residue. The latter case explains a wide range of cases, in general the fact that phantasia is more prone to error than perception. Finally I analyse the activity of phantasia. I argue that its content is propositional, in particular it is ‘S is P’: a predication of a perceptible feature P of a thing that caused a perception S. First, I show that it is implausible to construe simple cases of phantasia (or perception: for perception has the same type of content as phantasia) as non-propositional, demonstrating that the object reading of the content (x sees ‘white’) is inadequate in that at the best it reduces to existential propositions (‘there is white’). Again, I analyse two positive evidences. (1) Alexander`s account of the truth-conditions of phantasia implies propositional content: phantasia is about an existent thing, S; and it is such as the thing, P. (2) The account of simultaneous perception (of several perceptibles) entails propositional content, and even uses examples as ‘this is white’. The phantasia-activity is said to be krisis, which I take to be judgement: primarily because its content is propositional. I argue that it is a certain type of judgement, perceptual, in contrast to conceptual judgements of the rational soul-part: esp. opinion. However, phantasia-judgement may be distinguished from perceptual judgement only because they are concerned with different objects: internal vs. external.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD'}"

First, what is narrative? Second, if some narratives are fiction, what makes them so? Third, what can one learn from narrative art? Fourth, what is the difference between experiences that are lived and experiences that are conjured up through empathy by narratives? Fifth, how should narratives be interpreted, and do they need to be interpreted based on the communicative intentions of their makers? Sixth, what is the role of narratives in everyday life and in connection to one’s identity? And lastly, seventh, what is the role of the imagination in creating and comprehending narratives? These are all central issues in the study of narrative, and both the problems and the answers branch out into core areas of philosophy: metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind and philosophy of action. After the definition of narrative, the six chapters are divided into three groups: truth, meaning and mind. First then, even though ‘narrative’ is a widely used term in a variety of disciplines, it is an elusive one. I make a distinction between narrative artworks and elements, argue that most narratives artifacts are patchworks of narrative and non-narrative elements, and I approach narrative artifacts in three steps: 1) as representations; 2) ones that typically make sense of what they represent; and 3) as products of intentions. Second, many philosophers draw the line between fictional and non-fictional narratives based on the claim that the contents of fiction are intended to be imagined by the audience – this is what defines fiction irrespective of truth and falsity. In contrast, I argue that fictional narratives cannot be true, and I consider some difficult cases which would warrant the opposite view. I maintain that ‘being fictional’ and ‘being true’ are incompatible for narratives. Third, it is contentious whether art is an appropriate vehicle of learning, or, whether it has ‘cognitive value’ that is significant in an aesthetic way. My argument is that the most important lessons of art are not truths in propositional form, rather, art provides one with experiential knowledge, with knowing, to a degree, what it is like to be in certain situations. Fourth, while narrative artworks have the capacity to evoke certain experiences (and thus provide experiential knowledge), it is not clear what the difference is between experiences as lived and experiences as evoked by narrative artworks. I defend the view that, in contrast to experiences as lived, experiences evoked through empathy by narrative artworks are meaningful in a specific way. Fifth, philosophers have long been debating whether artists’ intentions should play a role in interpreting artworks. In this chapter, I carve out a qualified position: when it comes to what story a narrative artworks tells, one should refer to intentions, however, one need not do so when understanding what themes are developed by the work or when examining the functions of details that contribute to developing these themes. Sixth, many claim, not just in philosophy but in psychology as well, that narratives are important when it comes personal identity. Some think they constitute one’s ‘self’ or, at the least, make actions and events in one’s personal history intelligible. I argue for a different view: narratives are important for personal identity because they communicate, intentionally and unintentionally, who one is, and they provide access to self-knowledge and opportunity for self-shaping. Seventh, as mentioned, philosophers tend to think that fictional narratives are distinguished by their prescribing the imaginings of their contents. In this last chapter, the position developed is that certain kinds of imagination are necessary for both creating and comprehending narratives irrespective of their fictionality. All in all, the thesis provides much needed conceptual clarifications, and it develops novel and original arguments and views regarding central topics in the study of narrative, making the study of narrative relevant beyond aesthetics for other areas of philosophy.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1997k)'}"

This sharply contrasts with received views that competence-based exclusion and equality of the franchise are two different compromises struck between political equality and political quality. In Part I, I address franchise restrictions below the competence threshold. In Chapter 1, I argue for an interpretation of the ""all subjected principle"" that pro tanto requires that those less-than-minimally competent should be enfranchised. Chapter 2 examines Thomas Christiano\'s pro tanto argument for excluding those less-than-minimally competent from the electorate. I show here that an account justifying the right to vote by interests grounded in minimal competence—the capacity to make moral judgments—can only argue that excluding the insufficiently competent is permissible, but not required. Chapter 3 criticizes a pro tanto argument requiring the enfranchisement of less-than-minimally competent citizens based on the expressive or symbolic significance of voting. I reconstruct several versions of the argument to show that the best version can only offer a relatively weak pro tanto case for inclusion, and even that case is in some doubt. Chapter 4 provides two pro tanto arguments for exclusion based on political equality as between citizens, on the one hand, and as between \'mere\' citizens and their representatives, on the other. I argue that political equality requires us to avoid an excessive risk of votes not backed up by sufficiently independent voting-relevant judgments, which gives us pro tanto reasons to exclude those who are unable to form an independent judgment, and would serve as vehicles of someone else\'s electoral will. I argue, though, for a rather permissive, socially embedded interpretation of what independence in moral judgment requires. Chapter 5 criticizes an external competence-based restriction on the franchise, showing that Jason Brennan\'s argument from a right against incompetent rule to an alleged right to competent voters is unsound.  In Part II, I justify equal voting power despite variations in voting competence above the threshold. Chapter 6 criticizes Thomas Christiano\'s argument for the same conclusion. I argue in this chapter that one of his arguments is necessary but insufficient to establish equal voting power, but the other one is incompatible with representative democracy. In Chapter 7, I present a novel account of equal voting power despite inequalities of competence. Instead of arguing that political equality is a constraint on the pursuit of substantive equality, I show that in liberal democracies, substantive requirements of equality and the requirement of competent government they trigger do not even conflict with political equality and equal voting power specifically. So, since political equality pro tanto requires equal voting power, and competence requirements do not conflict with this requirement, equal voting power is all things considered required despite variations in competence above the threshold.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1545k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

In response, I show that Sextus provides a narrative accounting for the original motivations of inquirers, as well as for the eventual split among dogmatists and Pyrrhoneans. On this account, suspension does not do away with the possibility of inquiry, rather keeps one removed from dogmatic commitments that would terminate inquiry. In Chapter 2, I examine the claim that Pyrrhoneans suspend about dogmatic theology, but engage in cultic practices of their societies without breach of their suspensive policy. I argue that the conformism advocated by Sextus is not dogmatic, and that possible hypocrisy is not his concern. Against the suggestion that ancient religion did not require beliefs subject to sceptical examination, I argue that this reading fails to provide a philosophically charitable account. In contrast, the general Pyrrhonean stance easily applies. In Chapter 3, I turn to the arguments against theology in PH III. I analyse the arguments about the conception, existence, and providential activity of gods. I raise the possibility that these constitute an extended argument against the conceivability of god, as far as dogmatic arguments go. I also discuss the peculiarity of providential arguments, in that they indicate discomfort about dogmatic positions unaffected by the inconceivability claim, leading Sextus to a dialectical appropriation of ordinary standards of impiety. In Chapter 4, I argue that the discussion of conceptual aetiology in M IX is compatible with the parallel discussion in PH III. While the arrangement of the material in M IX gives rise to worries about Sextus' editorial competence as well as about the fixity of his agenda, none of these worries proves substantial. I also argue that the contrast between 'more dogmatic' and 'more aporetic' parts of Sextan argumentation points to the different origin of materials incorporated into his position. In Chapter 5, I argue that the stance of Cotta in Cicero's De Natura Deorum resembles that of Sextus. While both Cicero and Cotta represent a Clitomachean variant of scepticism, the character Cicero retains his commitment to an assumption of divine providence, which explains his provisional judgement in favour of Stoic theology. In contrast, the dialogue at large expresses Cicero's wavering generated by conflicting commitments, and is thus more a piece of sceptical stagecraft than a meticulous presentation of philosophical options of the day. In Chapter 6, I argue that there is no principled way to decide the 'realist'-'idealist' debate concerning Epicurean theology. 'Realists' cannot offer an unproblematic account of the physical existence of gods, while 'idealists' endanger the criterial role of preconceptions. An innate disposition to conceive of god does not carry the day for 'idealists', though it highlights the ethical orientation of Epicurean theology. I suggest that Epicurus could have been genuinely uninterested in theological tenets not immediately relevant for the good life, and consider his theory of multiple explanation in this context."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2358k)'}"

Chapter 1 discusses realist and projectivist versions of manipulability, as well as related theories of causation. Concerning the debate over the aims Woodward manipulability approach, I argue for investigating manipulability from a metaphysical perspective. I further focus on arguments for connecting manipulability to causal realism, namely a version of the ‘No Miracle’ argument and an argument from objectivity. Finally, I discuss a potential objection against causal realism by Price. Chapter 2 discusses the problem of the causal asymmetry from a manipulationist perspective and argues that Woodward’s particular version of manipulability does not provide a satisfactory account of the asymmetry. After examining several accounts of the causal asymmetry, I propose connecting the causal asymmetry to temporal direction. As a metaphysical claim, I hold that the temporal features grounding the asymmetry are among the more fundamental constituents of causal relations that ground manipulability. A weaker claim connecting manipulability to temporal direction holds that the understanding of the causal asymmetry springs from the understanding of the temporal direction, which is further used in claims about causation and manipulability. I answer the main objections against such proposal. Finally, I use this view to answer Price’s objection discussed in chapter 1. Chapter 3 examines manipulability from a functional perspective. Through psychological data on causal and diagnostic reasoning, I explain why the asymmetry of causation is a problem in functional context as well. I also single out three features of Woodward’s account that can be classified as metaphysical assumptions that limit the extent to which manipulability works in functional contexts. Chapter 4 exemplifies how the previously identified constraints come into place. First, I argue that in developmental context there are several ways of inferring causally, and temporal cues are unaccounted for from the manipulability perspective. Secondly, I argue that it is difficult to use Woodward’s interventionist counterfactuals in cognitive development cases due to the subjects’ difficulty of working with counterfactuals. Thirdly, contra the non-backtracking interpretation of counterfactuals inherent to Woodward’s theory, I show that there are cases that can be accounted for through causal models that allow backtracking. I argue that some of these issues could be solved through connecting manipulability to causal direction or through employing the agency concept of causation.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1544k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

Many theists have tried to face this problem by defending God’s cause, or by justifying the presence of badness in the world created and managed by a supremely good Being. These attempts are called theodicies. Coupled with and inseparable from the theodicean efforts are the investigations of the philosophers and the theologians aimed at isolating the original cause of all evil, so that the responsibility for it could be transferred from God to that entity or phenomenon. Exactly these are the issues with which I occupy myself in this dissertation, although from a specific viewpoint. More precisely, my research interest lies in the theodicy and the theory of evil as conceived and presented by Plato. However, no statement concerning the content of the phrases ‘Platonic theodicy’ and ‘Platonic theory of evil,’ would be readily acceptable to anyone, or totally divorced from the aura of contentiousness and controversy. Some critics will find the first more-or-less elaborate theodicy in the fragments of the Early Stoics, while others will credit Plotinus or St. Augustine with the introduction of the main theodician strategies, prevalent and popular even today. Many others will hold that Plato’s theory of evil, if he had one at all, was rather impromptu and inconsistent. Therefore, the overarching aim of this work is to demonstrate that none of the above beliefs fully corresponds to the truth. My dissertation consists of two parts. In Part One I focus on specific sections and passages of the Republic, the Timaeus and the Laws, in order to demonstrate that Plato was indeed seriously engaging with the problem of evil, and that he devised a much wider variety of theodicean strategies than it is usually thought. Among them are the Freedom of choice solution, the Principle of plenitude, the Rival substance solution, the Aesthetic theme. In Part Two I explore passages from a group of Latter Middle and Late dialogues, namely the Theaetetus, the Timaeus, the Politicus and the Laws, from which most of Plato’s mature theory of evil may be extracted. There I argue for the so-called ‘material theory’ of the origin of evil, and try to demonstrate that Plato never wavered between a corporeal and psychic cause of evil. Thus the two basic theses which I wish to put forward in this dissertation are: a) that Plato did his best to provide a relatively comprehensive theodicy; b) that despite appearances to the contrary, he had a consistent theory of evil, and that he identified the corporeal constituent of the universe as the cause of its existence. My hopes are that this dissertation will offer at least a small contribution to the investigation of Plato’s theory of evil, and especially to the question of Plato’s theodicy, which is one of the rare underdeveloped areas in the field of Platonic studies.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2499k)'}"

This goal is to be achieved in four steps, corresponding to the four chapters of the thesis. Chapter I starts off by outlining a scientific approach to the problem of dream skepticism. The distinguishing feature of this approach is its attempt to provide scientific understanding of dreams with emphasis on how we are deceived in dreams. This chapter hopefully, provides us with a proper understanding of dreams: in dreams we are deluded due to impaired cognitive capacities such as reflective thought and memory, but this situation can be improved by learning to have lucid dreams. The goal of Chapter 2 is to show the specific character of dream skepticism in comparison with arguments using other types of skeptical scenarios such as the brain-in-a-vat (BIV) and the Matrix. For each of these scenarios two types of skeptical arguments could be devised. I call them A type and B type arguments. I will compare how this argument works with different skeptical scenarios. The conclusion of Chapter 2 will be the identification of the premises of the skeptical arguments which can be questioned if we have a proper understanding of dreams. Both traditional skeptics and modern anti-skeptics agree that in dreams we lack knowledge. But the lack of knowledge in dreams need not be an obstacle in fighting dream skepticism. Some strategies insist that as long as one can know that one is not dreaming while awake, it is irrelevant whether one can know that one is dreaming while dreaming. Chapter 3 explores some of these strategies. I argue that these strategies are vulnerable to what I call “Hobbes’ objection” according to which as long as dream experiences that can seem every bit as well ordered and well-connected within the dream world, as waking experience is in the real world are allowed, the proponents of these strategies will be unable to decide if they are awake or dreaming. In Chapter 4 I propose a way for avoiding Hobbes’ objection. The full response to dream skepticism requires the possibility of effectively distinguishing dreams and waking experiences. This is possible for a lucid dreamer. The final sections of the thesis are dedicated to responses to the objections to the approach I suggested. The main objection could be formulated like this: is it necessary for everyone to learn how to dream lucidly in order to know any proposition about the external world? Hopefully, answers to this objection will give us some interesting insights into the nature of our knowledge of the external world.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1122k)'}"

In the last four decades many linguist, philosopher and cognitive scientist, working on an account of how we communicate by means of metaphors, started with pointing out what Davidson got wrong or right. His view that metaphor carries no special meaning or content different form the literal meaning of the expressions it is comprised of, that it is simply a tool to draw our attention to similarities, served as the starting point for many to articulate their own theory (cf. Bergmann, 1982; Rorty and Hesse, 1987; Moran, 1989; Hills, 1997; Stern, 2000; Camp, 2003; Guttenplan, 2005; Reimer and Camp, 2006; Camp, 2008; Stern, 2008; Reimer, 2008; Lepore and Stone, 2010). \ue053is thesis is no different. I think what Davidson essentially got right is emphasizing the causal effects of metaphors, i.e., that metaphors nudge us into noting similarities, to take on a new perspective on the mentioned things. He also thought—to anticipate, this will be where I disagree—that this is the ulterior aim of metaphor and the metaphorical speaker. Consequently, according to Davidson, there is no special meaning the speaker aims to convey, given that this effect can be achieved by the literal meaning of the uttered sentence, or its comprehension thereof. \ue053is is not to deny that the metaphor has a point iv or that it inspires a lot of thoughts. In his Communication and Convention, Davidson (1984, 273) links what he calls ulterior purposes of utterances to John L. Austin’s notion of perlocution (Austin, 1962); acts people perform by uttering sentences. Such an act for instance is, making the audience to undertake certain actions by asking them to do so, or to surprise them by what one is saying. Given this much, Davidson (1978) can be described as developing a perlocutionary theory of metaphor (cf. Lepore and Stone, 2010). My aim is to show that a perlocutionary theory does not have to follow Davidson’s arguments and conclusions, just roughly outlined above. After a careful examiniation of the notion of metaphorical meaning, the perspectival effect of metaphors, and the notion of perlocution and perlocutionary effects, I will argue, first, that metaphors’s effect of making us see something in a new light is indeed a perlocutionary effect. I call this the Perlocution Claim. Second, I will also point out that achieving perlocutionary effects are not necessarily the ulterior purposes of the speakers. In most cases, they are just one among the many intended effects a speaker can have in uttering something. Consequently, Davidson’s claims about the casual effects of metaphors will not support his conclusion that there is no metaphorical meaning beyond the perspectival effect of metaphors, in as much as there are examples where eliciting the metaphorical effect is not the final aim of the speaker. Examples are not hard to find, and they support the existence of metaphorical meaning contrary to Davidson. Nevertheless, recent theories of metaphorical meaning do not fit well with the Perlocution Claim. Partly, because they reject the claim as belonging to Davidsonian non-cognitivsm (cf. Stern, 2000), a label introduced to designate theories denying the existence of metaphorical meaning. Additionally, because they also consider perlocutionary effects to be final, non-linguistic, aims of utterances. \ue053e proposed theory of metaphor endorsing the Perlocution Claim relies on the v distinction between different possible realizations of perlocutionary effects. It incorporates a non-cognitivist theory for some examples of metaphors while at the same time, using the same theoretical framework, it provides an account of how metaphorical utterances have a special meaning on certain occasions. As a theory of metaphorical meaning, it is close to that developed by Elisabeth Camp (2003; 2008; 2014) on which if there is a metaphorical meaning, it is an inexplicit meaning which the hearer has to recover by way of cultivating the perspective offered in the metaphor.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (641k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

Although the production of artefacts has been a constant activity of humans since the dawn of history, the Ancient world tended to disvalue it, considering it a lower endeavour that aims to satisfy ignoble material needs. Technology, according to Ancient Greek thinkers, cannot surpass nature but can only bring small improvements to it; moreover, there is a difference in kind between natural things and technological artefacts; the activity of inventing and producing useful objects is unsuited for the nobility and for free men; there is an irreducible gap between proper knowledge and the production of artefacts. This approach toward technology is completely reversed in Bacon’s and Descartes’ works: material utility comes to be considered a genuine value; nature can be completely transformed through technological inventions, and even the human body can be improved by prostheses; natural things and technological artefacts are identical in their constitution and function; the invention of new artefacts becomes a proper endeavour of the natural philosopher; thinking about artefacts, or machines, is raised to the status of proper knowledge, while mechanical arts and mechanics become the core of natural philosophy. These ideas regarding technology became the familiar background of the contemporary approach toward material production; accordingly, to understand the magnitude of Bacon’s and Descartes’ paradigm shift it was necessary to analyse it against the pre-modern view. Moreover, in order to emphasize their powerful influence I approach their works from the technological perspective, since an epistemological analysis fails to rend justice to and to clarify some of the core ideas of their philosophy: utility, the centrality of mechanical arts and mechanics, the scope and scientific character of technology, the similarity between nature and technology.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (3940k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

I propose an investigation which unfolds in two parts. In the first part, I examine the relationships that hold between personal autonomy, political authority and rationality, focusing on a reading of these relationships according to which, even though autonomous individuals may not a have reason to comply with the directives of political authority as long as they consider the matter from the standpoint of individual rationality, they may nevertheless have a reason to comply with such directives if they consider the matter from the standpoint of collective rationality. I explore the strengths and limitations of a model that tries to provide the normative foundations of political obligation by employing the principle of collective rationality, and conclude that, while the principle of collective rationality plainly dictates a greater level of compliance with the law than the principle of individual rationality taken in conjunction with an individual’s moral values would dictate, the same considerations which are invoked to establish the need to appeal to a principle that would give one a reason to obey the law over and above what substantive moral principles working within the framework of individual rationality give one reason to do might render implausible any attempt to account for political obligation by reference to such substantive moral principles. To deal with this difficulty, I introduce a particular conventionalist account, hoping to take a step in the direction of rehabilitating the idea that the reasons for obeying the law can be accounted for by appeal to substantive moral considerations.  In the second part, I scrutinize the main arguments used within the conventionalist framework that I focus on in order to back up the claim that political obligation, if it exists, can only be accounted for in terms of interdependent reasons for action. I look at the idea that a promising strategy in dealing with the problem of political obligation is to show that the treatment of ordinary coordination problems can be extended to other game theoretic situations, such as the prisoner’s dilemma. I find that the conventionalist account is able to answer the objection that any conventionalist account of authority and political obligation is misguided because the conventionalist analysis cannot properly be applied to situations of significant conflict of interests. I also argue that, in order to defend the conventionalist view according to which political obligation is to be justified by reference to a pattern of mutual expectations, one should make crucial use of the idea of cooperative dispositions. To this end, I show that conventionalists are right in claiming that assumptions about cooperative dispositions are not ad hoc, and, hence, that conventionalism can make sense of the idea that patterns of mutual expectations are not immune to moral criticism.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1326k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

On close analysis these global conceptions turn out to be less than helpful in capturing the being of an environment, and quite inefficient in environmental arguments due to their abstractness and remoteness from people’s everyday lives and concerns. Contrary to these approaches, this thesis attempts to grasp environments in their plurality through the analysis of everyday environmental experiences. The method used is a version of generative phenomenology, inspired by the works of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger and Jan Patočka, but adapted to the study of historical and dynamic phenomena such as environments. As a result of this pluralist phenomenological approach the being of environments is revealed to have two inseparable and co-generative aspects: an autonomous existence as a field of possibilities (affordances) and a hermeneutical realm composed of human ways to make sense of the surrounding world. This pluralistic, flexible and open-ended ontology turns out to have not only theoretical benefits in mediating between realist and constructivist positions, but also important practical consequences.

In particular, I propose a solution to the problem, known in philosophical aesthetics as ‘the paradox of ugliness’, namely how we can value something that we prima facie do not like and find positively displeasing. I develop my explanation of ugliness in light of Kant’s theory of taste put forward in the Critique of the Power of Judgment. Even though Kant did not write about ugliness, I argue that his explanation of the beautiful has much to say about its opposite. This, however, is not immediately apparent. Even more, recent studies have argued that Kant’s explanation of the feeling of pleasure in the beautiful leaves no possibility to accommodate judgments of ugliness. In short, the argument is the following: according to Kant, judgments of taste have a subjective universal validity, because they depend on the state of mind of free harmony between imagination and understanding that we all share, and which is a subjective condition of cognition. But this state of mind of free harmony produces the feeling of pleasure alone. Hence, there is no possibility to accommodate judgments of ugliness, that is, a universally communicable state of mind of free disharmony between imagination and understanding that would give rise to the feeling of displeasure within us. Worse yet, it has been argued by Paul Guyer that the existence of a disharmonious state of mind is inconsistent with Kant’s epistemological theory. A harmonious relation between cognitive powers is required for the basic awareness of the representation itself. Accordingly, we cannot even be conscious of a representation in which imagination and understanding were in disharmony. Hence, pure ugliness is epistemologically impossible. In this dissertation I argue for the opposite view, namely, that Kant’s theory of taste does allow for the possibility of pure judgments of ugliness. I critically review the main interpretations of Kant’s central notion of the free play of imagination and understanding, and then develop a new interpretation of free play, one, that takes into consideration Kant’s account of reflective judgments and the a priori principle of purposiveness, and which allows for the epistemological possibility of a disharmonious state of mind and ugliness. Finally, I apply my interpretation of ugliness in Kant’s aesthetics to resolve two main problems in contemporary aesthetics, that is, the possibility of appreciating natural and artistic ugliness, and the role of disgust in contemporary artistic representation.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1496k)'}"

The first is to hold a Cartesian view regarding singular thoughts, that is, to hold that a thought is singular because of its structural features, and not because the subject who entertains it is acquainted with a certain existent. The second is to assert that singular thoughts expressed by the use of a proper name are composed of dynamic senses. There are two consequences of this second claim. The first is that the identity conditions for a singular thought do not entail concept-by-concept identity. The second consequence is that a proper version of Descriptivism must focus on tokens of proper names. The view that answers best to both demands is, I believe, a version of Cluster Descriptivism that is supplemented by the idea that the weights of the descriptions present in a cluster are adjusted according to contextually-available information. The last claim that I shall make is that definite descriptions included in the cluster that gives the meaning of a proper name are two-dimensional singular terms. The claim can be rephrased by saying that the historical connection between “the” and “that” is not mere contingency. As an added bonus, uses of an incomplete definite description are treated similar to those of a proper name: any completion of the description by qualitative material that singles out the intended object is viewed as communicating the same singular thought.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1492k)'}"

This idea is not itself a piece of psychology, but a philosophical commitment derivative from the historical struggle of psychology to establish its scientific credentials. Here it is argued that these credentials are not threatened by accepting diverse patterns of explanation for dissimilar explananda. A specific version of this argument is developed in this thesis; its backbone is a distinction between the kinds of individuals that constitute the object of psychological explanation. Individuals are arranged from the equator of typical, socially competent, accultured persons, to various poles or ‘margins’. This arrangement reflects the degree of opacity of various persons, as seen from the interpretive standpoint of (their own) common culture. Two such poles are explored here: young children, and psychotic individuals. The first chapter presents evidence for the persistence through theoretical changes of the idea that psychology progresses as a natural science grounded in a unified explanatory pattern (Mill, James, Watson, Köhler, Marr). The chapter then focuses on two traditions which resist this view: the defense of the autonomy of the 'Geisteswissenschaften', areas of psychology here included (Dilthey, Collingwood); and Wittgenstein’s views about the applicability of (regular) psychological concepts in exceptional scenarios. The eventual target of invoking these sources of resistance is the popularity in recent developmental and clinical cognitive psychology of theories that assimilate the explanatory order of the ‘margins’ to that of the paradigm. The second chapter develops this idea in the developmental case (Tomasello’s shared intentionality model of early communication and cooperation), while the third focuses on psychosis (Frith’s theory of schizophrenia)."", 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (2806k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

In his influential book What We Owe to Each Other Thomas Scanlon distinguished two senses of responsibility, substantive responsibility and responsibility as attributability and provided a nuanced description and analysis of both concepts. Elaborating on the latter notion in a series of articles Angela Smith developed a unified account of attributonism, the “rational relations view”. According to Neil Levy’s formulation, “on the attributionist account, I am responsible for my attitudes, and my acts and omissions insofar as they express my attitudes, in all cases in which my attributes express my identity as a practical agent. Attitudes are thus expressive of who I am if they belong to the class of judgment-sensitive attitudes” (Levy 2005). One of the main advantages of attributionist accounts is that they are able to explain and justify some puzzling cases of responsibility: responsibility for attitudes and responsibility for involuntary omissions. These cases are troubling because they reveal an inconsistency in our ethical thinking: on the one hand, we seem to be committed to an important moral principle, the Control Principle, which states that it is unfair to hold people responsible for things beyond their control. But, on the other hand, with our ordinary judgments of responsibility we frequently assess people on the basis of such things over which they do not exercise control. In my thesis I wish to accomplish a dual aim. First, I give a comprehensive and thorough analysis of attributionist theories. I explore how they differ from apparently similar accounts, the strengths and weaknesses of their solutions to traditional problems of moral responsibility. I raise several objections and investigate whether attributionist accounts have the resources to answer them. Although I do not attempt to defend attributionist theories from every criticism, hopefully I can demonstrate that attributionism has several appeals which make it a genuine rival of more traditional accounts of moral responsibility. iv Second, exploring attributionist accounts serves more general purposes. The analysis, as I indicated, will lead us to the discussion of the Control Principle. I explore the problem emerging from the principle and give an abstract mapping of the possible solutions for it. One of these strategies lead us to the discussion of R. J. Wallace’s much debated normative interpretation, which claims that one is morally responsible for something if and only it is fair to hold her responsible—facts about responsibility are defined by normative considerations regulating the fairness of responsibility-attribution. The normative interpretation, put forward as a general schema, has far-reaching methodological consequences. Most importantly, as I will argue, any theory of responsibility has to define three variables: the scope of responsibility-attribution, the nature of the relevant responsibility-attributing practices and the substantive moral considerations about fairness which should be applied. Thus, in the second part of the thesis I will explore these topics as they arise for attributionist theories. Also, the normative interpretation raises fundamental and often neglected questions about the methodology of building up a theory of free will and responsibility and the division of labor between theories of responsibility and substantive normative ethical theories. At the end of the discussion I focus on these questions and try to clarify some important methodological issues which often remain implicit in the relevant literature.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1333k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

Frankfurt developed his hierarchical theory of desires. This controversial theory led to fruitful debates not only in connection with the problem of free will but in other areas as well including personal and practical identity, rationality in action and the problem of agency in general. Thus, this dissertation is not focused on the problem of free will but on the role of second-order desires in agency. More particularly, it discusses the importance of two features of human agency that Frankfurt emphasized most. First, humans are reflective, that is, they can evaluate their own desires. Second, humans are capable of caring about things, that is, some things are important for them in a special way. Frankfurt understands both of these crucial abilities as based on our ability to have second-order desires. In agreement with Frankfurt, I will argue that both reflectivity and caring are very important and basic abilities, and that they are connected to each other. However, I will disagree about their relation and about the definition of caring as dependent on second-order desires. I will argue that caring in the most basic sense is not a reflective ability but a first-order evaluation which is centrally important to action. I will also try to show that the reason humans have second-order desires is that they care about things. Thus, our second-order desires should be based on our personal values; in other words, what we care about. As a consequence, the most important claim of this dissertation is the following: though humans are reflective creatures, it is not reflectivity that is the most important feature of human life. Rather, caring, as a first-order evaluation is more important and our ability to reflect about our motivation depends on being able to care about things in this sense. At the end of the dissertation I will briefly discuss a serious problem for any caring based theory of action: the problem of self-control and self-management. Since we do not directly control by decisions what we care about, it seems that we cannot have these abilities. However, I will try to sketch a method of self-control and self-management which is consistent with the importance of the redefined concept of caring and which is based on self-trust and openness. This method will add one more argument against the importance of reflectivity: second-order desires do not help us in managing our desires; rather, they can interfere with self-control and become self-defeating strategies.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (694k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

While the national self-determination theories and the plebiscitary theories are too permissive and so could lead to limitless fragmentation, strategic bargaining and paralyzing of state functioning, the remedial right theories seem to involve a paradox; though they are designed in a way that would prevent violence, they seem to have a counter effect and promote violence. In addition to this, the former types of theories cannot be seen as good grounds for secession, since they conceive of it as a primary right, which the right to secession cannot be. The latter theories, on closer inspection, turn out to be too narrowly construed, and so only able to address a limited number of cases of justifiable secession. The aim of this dissertation is to develop a new, comprehensive theory of secession, which is able to free itself from the objections raised against the existing theories and can adequately explain how secession is possible considering the claims states have against their people and against other states. It seeks to do so by setting up guidelines for a complete theory by looking into detail into the nature of the right to secession and point out theoretical misconceptions and puzzles of the existing theories. I develop the theory within the framework of democratic theory. The key concept of this dissertation is the concept of legitimate boundaries. I claim that secession is not possible as long as the boundaries of a state are legitimate and vice versa. The state can be said to have legitimate boundaries as long as it has legitimate political authority and I take the best version of it to be democratic authority. Since authority cannot be limitless, I identify the main limits to democratic authority. On my account secession becomes justifiable when the state has lost legitimate authority on both the intrinsic/inherent and instrumental dimension. The notion of legitimate boundaries, in combination with the residual right argument, then explains that even though the state does not have legitimacy of boundaries anymore other states and the stateâ€™s population cannot just divide the territory without further ado. However, I identify trumping circumstances that enable certain groups of the failed state to take a part of the territory and create their own state. In addition to developing my own account I also show that secession is not a primary right, since that either entails that the state is seen as a voluntary association, which a state is not and cannot be, or it entails that secession is an instance of self-determination, however even if we can find arguments for understanding self-determination in its external sense, we can only do so in terms of appealing to some injustices thereby rendering it a derivative and not a primary right.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1363k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted'}"

I focus on a recurrent argument in the recent metaethical literature, according to which the moral objectivist can respond to the challenge posed by the pervasiveness and intractability of moral disagreement by appealing to the idea of moral indeterminacy. A substantial part of the dissertation is devoted to showing that this response to the argument from moral disagreement is not free of difficulties. One of the main worries has to do with the fact that, since moral indeterminacy cannot be a pervasive phenomenon, it seems that the best strategy available to the objectivist is to maintain that there is also a considerable amount of convergence in moral belief, and that this convergence in belief is best explained on objectivist assumptions. Yet, if responding to the argument from moral disagreement involves defending both the claim that there are indeterminate moral issues and the claim that convergence in moral belief can suitably be regarded as the result of a reliable epistemic mechanism, a worry might arise as to whether an adequate defense of both the aforementioned claims can be mounted from the perspective of the same version of moral objectivism. The worry is that defending the former claim may be easier if one embraces a version of cognitivism which delivers a weaker form of objectivity, while defending the latter claim may be easier if a version of cognitivism which delivers a stronger form of objectivity is vindicated. I claim that moral realism has the resources to account for both the aforementioned claims. On the one hand, I argue that moral realism has no trouble accommodating moral indeterminacy. On the other hand, I argue that moral facts figure in the best explanation of our moral beliefs. Moreover, I argue that despite common assumptions to the contrary, the claim that moral facts can play causal explanatory roles can consistently be endorsed by both naturalists and nonnaturalists.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1929k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

Cicero himself does not consider himself an original thinker, or even a professional philosopher; but he regards himself as a competent and intelligent expositor, in addition to being an unmatched stylist and a public person possessing sufficient gravitas and auctoritas to effectively promulgate Greek philosophy in Rome. This self-assessment has been mostly approved in scholarship on Hellenistic philosophy over the last three or four decades; although in recent years there has been an increasing awareness of the need to pay due heed to the various cultural and personal factors that informed Cicero’s perception of the different doctrines and theories he discusses in his philosophical works. My dissertation attempts to contribute to this trend by exploring Book III of Cicero’s De finibus, as our central source for early Stoic ethics and as part of Cicero’s philosophical work. The Stoics have presented us with the most radical development on the Socratic ethical legacy in Antiquity, by championing the view that virtue is the only intrinsic “good” required to live a happy life. The fullest account of their case for this position has come down to us in Cicero’s presentation in De finibus III; but even this presentation is highly problematic in a way that has (as I see the matter)substantially contributed to the emergence of the extensive and highly fascinating recent debate over the right understanding of the “foundations” of Stoic ethics. In my dissertation I argue to the effect that this debate ought to be recast in terms of a renewed awareness of how De finibus III functions and interacts as part of De finibus as a whole –that is, renewed awareness of Cicero’s presence behind the text as the author of De finibus, a complex essay on what Cicero perceives as the central problem in moral philosophy. In consequence of such an approach, I argue, we have to redraw the limitations of Cicero’s report as a testimony; for Cicero views and interprets the Stoic theory from an interpretive perspective that is liable to systematically distort the Stoic theory.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1594k)', 'Access': 'ETD'}"

The whole thesis is an attempt at showing that CEP is not quite a firm ground for building up an argument that interactionism could not be an answer to the mind-body problem.

The key point of my thesis is the endeavor to set up such a kind of compatibilist scenario.

Intentionality is the property of a mental state to be directed at external objects/states of affairs. No theory of perception denies that perceptual experiences put us in contact with the world; the debate is over what makes experience have this feature. There are theories that claim that perceptual experience is essentially of external things and there are theories that argue that perceptual experience becomes of external things.  Therefore, there are two ways of saying that experience is intentional: as a claim directed against a certain structure of experience (relational), and as a phenomenological thesis – the phenomenal character of experience is essentially representational. In this dissertation, I analyze how these two claims relate to each other. It is clear that they cannot be equivalent since the phenomenal thesis is directed not only against the sense-data theory but also against the qualia view, which is not a relational view. I argue that a major shift has occurred in the strategy of arguing for the intentionality of experience.

In Logical Investigations Husserl seeks to divorce logic and meaning from its psychological interpretations and to establish a firm argument for the ideality of meaning. He achieves his goal, but the outcome provoked many further questions about the understanding of ideality and the actual process of meaning-constitution. In Ideas Husserl provides a comprehensive account of meaning as ideal noema given in conscious experience. He also clarifies the relation between ideality and reality by means of introducing a new phenomenological method of philosophizing. His advanced theory of meaning receives even more detailed elaboration in his last major work Experience and Judgment, where he demonstrates that the origins of every meaning are deeply rooted in our prepredicative experience. Relying on his theory of time-consciousness he also shows that meaning is omni-temporal, i.e. constituted within time-consciousness but existing over and above any act of constitution. The purpose of my inquiry is, first, to clarify the development of Husserl’s concept of meaning with regards to his changing views on the status of the science which has conceptual meaning as its object, i.e. logic (and phenomenology to a certain extent). The second aim is to demonstrate that his analyses of meaning are the crucial pivot of his epistemology throughout his works with a particular concentration on the three stages, namely, i) the justification of pure logic as a first a priori science and the refutation of psychologist (LU), ii)the shift to transcendental phenomenology (Ideen), in which logic plays only a preliminary role, and iii) the turn to transcendental aesthetics (EU) with an attempt to find a proper background for logic. The actual analysis does not aim to provide a complete account of Husserl’s thought at any of the stages, but to trace the development of a comprehensive theory of meaning underlying the problems which led Husserl to each subsequent stage and demonstrating whether and to what extent he provided a satisfactory answer to them."", 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1498k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

I argue that persons are real, irreducible, ultimate components of reality. Their identity is a primitive fact that cannot be fully analyzed. This is the Simple View of persons. Its Consciousness-Based version is the best theory of personal identity we have.

At its surface are the empirical laws of nature, such as Newtonian law of gravitation or Einstein’s equations for gravitational field. At its deeper second level are the fundamental principles of science that determine the general spatio-temporal framework which enables the formulation and the testing of the empirical laws. At the third level are the philosophical meta-paradigms which guide the transition between scientific paradigms. The central epistemic claim of the model concerns the character of the fundamental principles; according to Friedman they are a priori, that is, they are independent from experience. Yet he is explicit that the principles change under empirical pressure. Friedman's position, however, faces the modern empiricist challenge instead of evading it: he has to explain how the principles could still be a priori if they change under empirical pressure. I argue that his defence, appealing to the old Reichenbachian notion of the constitutive a priori, is inconclusive. The present text provides a contemporary account of the epistemic character of the principles addressing the most recent work on the a priori. I argue that at least some principles are not empirically but a priori revisable, and in this way I respond to the empiricist challenge. In order to build the defence I formulate a general notion of epistemic revisability and I extract from it two corresponding kinds of specific revisabilities: an empirical and an a priori. I argue that the latter kind is as vital as the former and that it is also capable of meeting the argument from empirical revisability by providing an epistemic alternative of it. In this way, if some second level principles are shown to evolve through a priori revisions the leading empiricist argument fails. To demonstrate this I analyze two case studies, one from history of geometry and one from history of physics, and I show that the revisions were epistemically a priori and not empirical. The result is a two-fold one. First, a genuine alternative of empirical revisability is developed, and not just for a priori domains like mathematics but also for natural sciences. Second, a new mechanism for the dynamics of science is suggested, namely that scientific knowledge sometimes evolves through empirically independent moves. At the end, these enable a modern epistemic defence of the priori character of the second level principles in Friedman’s model and thus help to keep its vitality."", 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (818k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

This research is answering the question why, despite the existing legacy of federative relations with the substantial level of decentralization and accountability with democratic traditions German regions does not show good budgetary performance, whereas in the absence of historical legacy and accountability mechanisms and with the high level of political centralization in Russia, it is possible to create system with the better budgetary performance. The hypothesis of this research was that indeed, the historical heritage and democratic rules increase the level of decentralization and accountability, but this does not necessarily lead to better budgetary performance because of the weak budgetary constraints and incentives. The results of this study approve this hypothesis. Tested by crisp-set Qualitative Comparative analysis this research shows several important tendencies. Despite of the historical roots, federal legacy and democratic type of regime leading to a greater level of decentralization, budgetary performance is not a direct consequence of such a system. With a relatively high level of decentralization, many of Germany's decentralization mechanisms work towards a worse performance. In particular, a strong level of fiscal decentralization, a lack of transparent budgetary allocation mechanisms (which are mainly related to the type of parliamentary political system), and a large number of equalizing federal transfers together with an uncontrolled regional opportunity to borrow money lead to a worse budgetary performance in that country. On the other hand, a more centralized system with lower level of accountability more often shows the better results in terms of budgetary performance, although some centralization tendencies (primarily political ones) do not contribute to the best level of budgetary indicators.

The inordinate risks associated with mobilizing in non-democratic regimes such as the regime’s propensity to use force to repress dissent should decrease the likelihood of collective action, but people power movements have emerged and even been regarded as crucial to the democratization of some autocracies. Analyzing opportunity structures accessible to the movement provides a compelling framework in explaining how people power movements in non-democratic regimes mobilize and achieve successful outcomes. This thesis focuses on the interplay of two types of opportunity structures, namely the political opportunity structures (POS) and the discursive opportunity structures (DOS), to account for movement mobilization and achievement of outcomes. Through a comparative study of Myanmar’s People's Democracy Movement (1988) and China’s Tiananmen Democracy Movement (1989), this thesis explores how the variation in the degree of strength of POS and DOS of these movements contributes to mobilization and attainment of successful outcomes. In the case of Myanmar, it is shown that the strong presence of POS has not been fully maximized due to the movement’s failure to deeply engage the citizens in sustained collective action through the effective use of discursive opportunities. In the case of China, the strong presence of DOS has not been completely maximized due to its failure to recast the overall political context, undermine state legitimacy, and create possible opening of political opportunities. Both cases demonstrate that there may be a mismatch between existing and perceived opportunities, that the state can supplement its repressive apparatuses with persuasive repertoires to impede mobilization, and that failure to maximize both POS and DOS is a constraint in achieving movement resilience and undermining regime power and legitimacy."", 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Meanwhile, the crime-terror nexus is seen as a continued threat to global security and stability. However, there has been little academic attention paid to the use of organized crime by state-sponsored terror groups. This is largely because the current literature views the use of criminal fundraising as an alternative to state-sponsorship. Despite this, there are numerous examples of state-sponsored organizations which nevertheless engage in organized crime, representing a significant theoretical puzzle. This thesis addresses the question of why state-sponsored terror groups engage in organized crime by comparing the cases of Hezbollah and Mujahedin-e Khalq in light of the wider theoretical literature. Current literature on terrorism and crime tends to either focus on responses to economic necessity at the group level, or on the broader structure of opportunities and constraints. This thesis uses Theory-Guided Process-Tracing to incorporate these theories into the inductive case studies, finding that a theoretical synthesis is required to address this question. While responses to economic necessity occur, they are heavily mediated through the opportunity structures in which a group operates. This thesis also finds that the role of state-sponsors is more varied than previously acknowledged, with some states actively enabling crime. This shows the need for a theoretical approach which understands terror groups within their socio-economic and geopolitical context, while recognizing their complicated relationship with state actors. This thesis sketches out the beginnings of such a theory, suggesting several testable hypotheses.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Due to the displacement caused by land-use change, land-related conflicts have been a major problem in India. The thesis highlights two key imperatives of land markets and related institutional frameworks, namely, the jurisdictional (referring to the legal bases of land acquisitions, allocations, transfers, and conflict resolution) and the fiscal (the consolidation of economic benefits from land through investments and revenue generation). Fiscal realignments over the years have promoted subnational governments to use land value booms for local gains and use policy instruments to attract revenue through either foreign investments or land-leasing. Subnational governments have adopted different land liberalisation strategies based on their fiscal positions. The findings suggest that the strong presence of both avenues of land market liberalisation entails subnational units’ ability to retain competitiveness without initiating policies for aggressive land-grabbing and land-use change, which manifests itself in lower degree of land-related conflicts. The variation in conflicts unpacks the contradiction between two premises of subnational governments’ agenda – to promote local growth whilst meeting democratic demands for social protection. At the same time, the developments in land markets show that subnational units have largely not resolved these competing imperatives adequately. The presence of overlapping frameworks on land governance has meant that attempts at harmonisation have remained unsuccessful. Consequently, there has been inadequate institutionalisation of compensation and rehabilitation frameworks, and conflicts over land-use change have remained persistent.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

While the opposition decried it as austerity under another name, proponents argued it was a necessary reinvigoration of personal responsibility in the face of challenges like globalization and an aging population. Localized and targeted solutions would yield better outcomes and promote social cohesion beyond the cold state bureaucracy. This thesis takes stock of the literature investigating this apparent transition, before contextualizing it within broader welfare state change and participation research. Prominent shortcomings are identified and then addressed by presenting a comprehensive theoretical framework, built around the distinction between neoliberal and communitarian models of participation. This framework connects empirical and normative debates, explicitly identifies often unchallenged assumptions, and provides specific guidance as to how to locate and study potential access and equity issues in the shifting welfare landscape. A case study analysis of the Dutch participation society as national policy offers support for the frameworkâ€™s internal linkages, and highlights how the responsibility and self-sufficiency goals of the neoliberal model mean access and equity matter primarily in terms of outcomes. The subsequent micro-level analysis of citizen initiatives in Gouda identifies a communitarian model, centered on fostering social cohesion, and as such requires attention to the representativeness of participants.

Firstly, I expect that (H1) populist individuals attach less importance to candidate’s policy positions. This proposition is consistent with the antagonistic and dualistic nature of populism that allows individuals to fit most of their policy-oriented attitudes within a populist narrative framework independently from their ideological orientation. Secondly, since I believe that policy and valence are non-separable components, I expect that (H2) populists attach less importance to the competence of the candidate (task-related valence). Lastly, against the “evil elites”, elected representatives must be “honest”, “sincere”, and respect the “will of the people”. Because of this, I postulate that (H3) individuals with high affinity with populism attach more importance to how honest or “warm” the candidate is (non-task valence). These hypotheses are tested using 2016 American and 2017 French National Electoral Studies data. Results confirm that individuals who score high on populist attitudinal scale attach less importance to ideological proximity and competence and more to honesty when it comes to vote choice contradicting the “rationality” criteria of traditional proximity and valence models.

On the supply side I found the lack of cultural and behavioral consolidation of political elites and a social-institutional structure in which populist policy choices seem rational for politicians. External impacts, such as Hungary’s EU-accession, both mitigated and enabled economic populism.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The present research expands on the study of military behavior in domestic politics and sheds light on military activities beyond warfare and territorial security beyond combat. The analysis first constructs a sequential model of military decisions and outcomes to derive two hypotheses in the first step.It is hypothesized that armed forces are more likely to defect and expedite regime change if they have a better relation to citizens than to the government (H1). Furthermore, assuming that democracy requires the high cost of civilian control by definition, armed forces are more likely to allow democratization when the benefits of democracy to their function and wellbeing outweigh the cost of civilian control (H2). Through constructing a two-dimensional framework that encompasses a polity-military and a citizen-military dimension, the analysis compares civil-military relations between the dimensions, within and across the cases. The hypotheses are tested using empirical and formal modeling jointly with the purpose of completing the sequential model with utility functions for every decision path. The analysis finds that militaries not only matter in transitions, but that their decisions are decisive. Additionally, to support democratization, democracy has offer at least the same payoff as a defection, which should have the same utility as a military takeover, despite the high cost of civilian control.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The Black Pride 4 case, and the wave of other actions like it, are caused by an LGBT movement that has historically prioritized white gay voices and needs over those of QPOC.

Specifically, this thesis paper aims to investigate why active resource conflicts exists between stakeholders in the Sundarbans area and how such conflicts affect the sustainable governance of the Sundarbans. The study uses the concepts of co-management arrangements in the domain of the theory of property rights to investigate the research questions. The co-management arrangements essentially recognize the roles of local communities in dealing with resource conflicts by proving them decision-making powers. Due to its underlying capacity in managing resource-related conflicts, the study finds co-management theoretically most relevant to its research aims. As a method of empirical analysis, the study applies exploratory case study research in two villages near the Sundarbans Reserve Forest area, namely, Pathor Khali and Munshiganji. Using semi-structured interview techniques, the study performed 27 Key Informant Interviews from the case areas which include 20 local resource users, 3 Forest Department officials, and 4 NGO workers. A thorough analysis of the collected data reveals that the local mangrove-dependent communities face severe exploitation by the Forest Department and other government agencies in the form of rampant corruption and harassment. Despite participatory forest management arrangements for the Sundarbans are in place, the local mangrove resource users do not have any decision-making powers. In fact, local users are not allowed to enter the protected area without permit license and entry pass. Findings show that all the respondents, who are local resource users, pay, on average $6.25 to forest officials to get an entry pass every time. This rate is at least two times higher than the prescribed rate of the government. The study also finds that 80 percent of respondents, who usually enter the protected for resource collections, experienced kidnaping by pirates within the last one year. Those who were kidnapped paid, on average, $750 to free themselves from the pirates. Surprisingly, they received, namely, no assistance from Forest offices, security agencies, or locally elected politicians. Although, 85 percent of the respondents are willing to participate in the co-management activities for the sustainable governance of the Sundarbans, the presence of distrusts and frustrations over mangrove resource use remains very active among the local resource-dependent communities. The non-cooperation from the responsible state agencies is a major obstacle for efficiently implementing co-management arrangements which the study thinks is a crucial challenge for long-term conflict mitigation between the stakeholders and the better governance of the Sundarbans."", 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

What makes this shift of attitude even more interesting is the lack of a visible political or economic incentive for the Kandyans to have become subsumed under the Sinhalese identity, given that colonial favour mostly lay with non-Kandyan Sinhalese (known as low-country Sinhalese) who became immensely rich and powerful under colonial rule, and that consequently, Kandyan elites were more or less excluded from political power in post-colonial Sri Lanka as well. Kandy’s absorption into the mainstream political culture in Sri Lanka is interesting not only because of the strong sentiments of distinction felt and expressed by Kandyans initially, but also because of the entirely opposite trajectory taken by Tamil nationalism, which was also a nationalist movement in Sri Lanka that emerged in the wake of the colonial period. In order to explore this puzzle, the present study develops along lines of capital accumulation, spatial rearrangement and representation of political power, intermarriages, and religion as a binding factor, which are shown to be constituent – and intertwined – parts of the process of Kandy’s political identity being diluted over time. It employs a research methodology of the post-positivist tradition, relying on archival material, other secondary sources such as books and papers, as well as some field observations.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

A content analysis of the official party literature, speeches, articles, and legislative initiatives is conducted to see what role religion plays in the ideology of these parties before and after the refugee crisis, and how these ideological standpoints translate into practice in terms of religion policies and relationships with the churches. Main findings include that while the refugee crisis had an impact on how these parties use religion in their rhetoric, it does not necessarily mean an enhanced usage. While there is some convergence among the parties, ultimately it is hard to speak about a straightforward relationship towards religion. However, whether religion is used more for defining the ingroup or more for constructing the other, seems to have important implications in terms of the religion policies of these parties. On the other hand, relationship with the churches for the most part seems to depend on to what extent these organizations hold similar positions regarding particular issues, however, these relationships could very well result in different preferred regulations in terms of church-state relationships.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Results suggest that coverage on the minorities, mostly the Roma and refugees, relies on framing of their differences vis-à-vis majority population and related threats, and in some cases even denies these group the uniquely human attributes. However, data also suggest a softening of rhetoric for the Roma, and partly for the already accepted Hungarian minority, in periods succeeding the emergence of refugee crisis. These finding suggest the possible less out-group status of these groups, following the arrival of a culturally more distant “other”. Similar trends are also observable in the user conversations underneath the articles.

Starting from the tension between marketization and protection, this thesis uses Polanyian approach to shed light on the modes of embedding the economy in society in the face of marketization. Focusing substantially on the period of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government, known as an Islamic neoliberal political party, this thesis, firstly claims that the AKP has opted for embedding the economy in society by reconciling its Islamic identity with its neoliberal outlook. This has resulted in growing importance of reciprocity relations between the government and government-favoured trade unions, indicating a blurring of the boundaries between industrial and political realms. This thesis then shifts its focus to trade unions and provides an analysis of the tension and harmonization between unionsâ€™ interests and identities. This thesis argues that harmonization between identity and interest strengthens the reciprocal characteristic of the politics and grants privilege to certain trade unions. Moreover, the tension turns government-favoured unions into veto players, who act against the government in the face of clash of interests.

Given a significant decline in the levels of trust across the developed world, identifying factors that drive the trend becomes a goal worth to pursue. This thesis investigates whether the rise of the Internet and different ways of using it can be associated with changes in trust in the government. Using a rich source of survey data covering a decade in the United Kingdom and diverse statistical methods, the analysis proceeds from comparing users and non-users to predicting trust in the government in multivariate regression models, coupled with a stepwise method for model selection. The analysis produces a mixed picture. At first, the results fail to uncover any significant impact of the Internet. Then, however, a deeper analysis finds that time spent on the web is repeatedly associated with lower levels of trust. Concurrently, the use of online news sources as well as social networks are estimated to be positively related to trust in the government. This lends some support to Norris’ “vicious circle” theory and suggests that non-hierarchical online structures with a limited “gate-keeping” function are likely to foster trust in the government or at least neutralise a negative impact of traditional media sources. The analysis also reveals a strong convergence between trust in various institutions. Taken together, the findings signal a direction for further research, which should focus on comparing content of online and offline media sources as well as account for a puzzling alignment of different types of trust. On the metalevel, the results are revealing of shortcomings of traditional survey methods for Internet research and call for alternative ways of data collection, which would involve collecting observational data on Internet users. This would serve as a firm basis for a more in-depth analysis of the ways the Internet relates to political trust and social life in general.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Further, this may get intensified in places where television viewing levels are significantly high and where politics is able to permeate into private spheres. To test this claim, this study conducts a thematic analysis of two recent dramas from Turkey and online comments to these series by the audience. The analysis of the series and comments indicates that in Turkey, political events and actors find large representation in entertainment television and the political relevance of these portrayals are acknowledged by the audiences.

Recent advancements in ART have driven the expansion of a new form of bodily commodification that complicates the relationships and tensions between autonomy and dignity by removing more boundaries between what may and may not be sold. Ethical concerns about the commodification of human life and the exploitation of donors have led some to argue for the prohibition of gamete sale, but prohibitionist stances are also challenged on the grounds that they infringe personal autonomy.

The common feature of political science literature related to a social network is that they mostly focus on whether the individuals’ political views and their social networks co-evolve or not. According to the recent literature, social networks do not simply evolve but also stimulate our political behavior. Most of the literature finds that people seek individuals with similar political views to be friends with and individuals who often talk to each other tend to be more similar over time Although there is broad agreement on that while our social network is dynamically flourishing, it is also affecting our attitude, but the process of this impact is still not clear. This research aims to examine the channel between social affiliations to the changes of political behavior. The research uses network data collected from experiments to specify the social affiliation effects on the change of political views under a deliberation process. The results suggest that, on the one hand, political opinion significantly influences friendship network formation, which fosters social homophily. On the other hand, a significant spillover effect has found on the likelihood of political opinion change, where the spillover effect strongly depends on the peers’ network centrality.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Utilitarianism defines welfare as the morally relevant subjective conditions of sentient beings and confers moral value to all people, both present and future, in equal measure. While the number of future people will likely far exceed the present population, it is unnecessary to set aside present resources exclusively for future welfare promotion. However, concern for future welfare does require us to meet present needs sustainably so that a wide range of resources remain available for future use. Governments, which are necessary to overcome collective action problems and provide public goods, share our common moral obligation to promote sustainability. Of particular concern is our present capitalist economic system of resource allocation, which is facilitating drastic increases in inequality and reducing the share of resources available to most people for welfare promotion; workplace automation is likely to exacerbate this. Without corrective intervention, this system will soon be insufficient to meet the needs of most people and is therefore unsustainable long-term. Concern for the welfare of future generations necessitates the provision of a redistributive universal basic income, which would counteract the economically deleterious effects of automation and ensure that all people—present and future—can enjoy sufficient economic security to promote their own welfare according to their subjective preferences.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I adopt a novel approach to tap into the multi-dimensional examination of authoritarianism, concentrating on three dimensions (authoritarian submission, conventionalism, authoritarian aggression) separately.

This thesis contributes to the existing research by examining whether women also face a glass cliff in the political sphere. More precisely, I argue that women are more likely to be selected as local and national party leaders when a party has been performing poorly in previous elections. However, I expect the glass cliff effect to vanish when female leaders are associated with that poor performance. To test these hypotheses, I use archival data on national party leaders in fourteen countries as well as data from an experiment on Amazon MechanicalTurk on local party leader elections. The generalised estimating equation models (GEE) of the archival data do not provide sufficient evidence for the existence of a glass cliff. Only the percentage of female politicians in a country increases the likelihood of having a female party leader. I am also unable to replicate the glass cliff phenomenon with the experimental data. The analysis of variance only indicates a significant difference in the choice of party leaders between men and women, but that effect is not dependent on the performance of a party.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Often, it has been described by pitting it against an instrumentalist, consequence-oriented voting behavior. Yet, this does not fully answer what expressive behavior is. Rather, it shows what it isn’t. In my thesis, I have attempted to show that non-consequentialist voting behavior is linked to the individual perception of a group’s opinion homogeneity or its heterogeneity. To this end, I attempt to measure voter turnout by measuring between-group heterogeneity and homogeneity. To do this, I draw from survey data collected from a survey study on the 2016 Romanian parliamentary election. Using this body of data, I operationalize opinion homogeneity and heterogeneity as distances between expressed opinions on the similarity and dissimilarity of competing political parties in the 2016 parliamentary elections. In order to measure these similarities or dissimilarities between parties, I employ the method of multidimensional scaling through Euclidean distances. This is not an exhaustive study, but rather a proposed roadmap towards future studies on expressive behavior. Finally, I find that the survey instrument works well in conjunction with the method of multidimensional scaling. However, limitations remain in pinpointing the exact nature of expressive behavior and, consequently, developing effective hypotheses is still a problem. In this regard, though much work has gone into the examination of the theoretical concept of expressive voting, work still needs to be done in unifying different strands of interpretation of expressive behavior.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The present work addresses this controversy by bringing the deterrence effect and the political selection effect that the predominant principalagent- theory based literature suggests to an empirical test in the critical case of Romania. This is done by assessing the impact of National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) prosecution in two forms – the announcement of investigations and the announcement of the final sentence – on favouritism in local public procurement.

Existing research suggests either ideological considerations revolving around the idea of economic nationalism as a principle motivation, or points to the distribution of ownership rights to political cronies. This thesis builds on these explanations by adopting a conceptualisation of economic nationalism as a framing and legitimisation-strategy, which does not necessarily correspond to material interests. I show that bank ownership changes are indeed politicised in a nationalist manner, therefore constituting a case of economic nationalism. However, the distributive consequences appear to be more selective than the rhetoric of national wellbeing suggests—ownership rights and credit are allocated to a select group of economic actors with close ties to the government while the alleged developmental goals are not realised. This is illustrated on the basis of an analysis of speeches held by the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, and interviews with Hungarian banking experts that provide insights into the intricate ownership developments and lending practices of the banks in question. Such a two-dimensional analytical framework is ultimately relevant for economic policymaking in Central and Eastern Europe more generally given that the politicisation of economic status as well as rent-seeking incentives continue to attract scholarly attention but are a perpetual source of conceptual conflation. Only a separation of political rhetoric, and distributive consequences can provide a holistic picture of such policies.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Results suggest that contrary to the dominant theoretical expectations, knowledge that information was shared voluntarily by the city council did not have any additional positive effect on citizens’ perceptions. However, non-government controlled acts of transparency affected perceived legitimacy of decisions negatively. Furthermore, knowing that information was leaked made people more likely to think that the decision making procedure was unfair and that the council was less trustworthy.

There have been policies, frameworks, and strategies devised by the European Union and by the Hungarian Government for the inclusion of the Roma. A key element of these measures is to tackle school segregation. This thesis focuses on the educational situation of the Roma in Hungary, specifically on school segregation. I hypothesize that the Hungarian Government’s legal commitment to non-discrimination and protection of discriminated groups are insufficient and obscure. Furthermore, I hypothesize that fighting against school segregation of the Roma, although it is claimed in the National Strategy for Social Inclusion to be eradicated, is not practically promoted by the Hungarian Government, therefore social inclusion of the Roma is hindered on the state level. After analyzing relevant legal documents, including strategies for social inclusion presented in my interviews with national experts on inclusive education, I argue that even though the legal framework for protection against discrimination in general is present, there is a need for targeted legal protection against discrimination of the Roma. Furthermore, I argue that a specifically Roma focused Hungarian national strategy for social inclusion need to be devised, which should be followed by targeted state-led and monitored actions for inclusion of the Roma. In the last part of this thesis work, I provide policy recommendations to the European Union and to the Hungarian Government in which I focus on those targeted measures with particular attention to quality enhancement of education, which ultimately lead to reducing discrimination and school segregation of the Roma.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

After empirically finding two such strategies in Europe, lateral expansion from the core territory to the whole country, called the extensive strategy, and developing an ideological profile, the intensive strategy, variables are distilled from the corresponding literature that are supposed to account for confining ethno-regionalist parties to specifically take either of the two modes of growth: the three independent variables are the strength of regional identity, the level of regional autonomy, and the desire to participate in the national government and to be a determining force there. After formulating the hypotheses, a qualitative comparative examination of four European cases follows. Altogether, these cases provide sufficient support for the hypotheses to see them largely satisfied. That is, European ethno-regionalist parties where the regional identity is weak, the level of autonomy is low or non-existent, and where it is a primary aim for the party to seek governmental positions will be likely to opt for the extensive strategy, while their peers with the opposite characteristics are expected to go for the intensive path.

The research hypothesis was in spite of a significant degree of centralization, which is one of the hallmarks of German federalism, this centralization and redistribution of revenues was necessary to manage Unification. To test this hypothesis, the historical institutionalism approach was applied. Owing to this method, it has become possible to identify the key features of the German federal design that considerably influenced fiscal federal arrangements in the Federation. These three features – cooperation, centralization (or unitarism), and symmetry become more pronounced and enforced by the federal government when there is a necessity to confront serious challenges to the economic well-being of the Federation, or political stability. As soon as the need for such consolidation decreases, the states tend to support policies that are more competitive. Overall, despite many tensions between the rich and less well-off states, centralization during the post-Unification period significantly eased the incorporation of East Germany to the Federal Republic. Starting from 2020, the equalization scheme will cease to function, and the states will have to rely on themselves and maintain balanced budgets, which may serve as a confirmation that the German fiscal federal system enters its less ‘cooperative’ phase.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The main hypotheses of the thesis are that candidates or parties are more likely to engage in negative campaigning under the following circumstances: i), when they stand behind in an election, ii) when the ‘race’ is close between competitors, ii) when in opposition, iv) when the actor is associated with a right-wing party, v) and when the actor is attacked by criticism from another opponent.

When it comes to political authority, meritocracy is also an important guideline people follow in order to achieve the best outcome of human resource and personnel arrangement for positions controlling authority and implementing policies. Even modern liberal societies embrace the value of meritocracy, despite the fact that liberal political account opposes negative effects of the overemphasis of meritocracy. This thesis explores the puzzle of the persistence of meritocracy from the perspective of meritocracy’s role in legitimatizing political authority. The function of power-forming contributes to meritocracy’s firm relationship with political authority, namely that the utilitarian feature makes meritocracy indispensable to political authority acquiring legitimacy, regardless of the type of political authority – ancient or modern authority, autocratic or liberal authority. However, in the framework of modern liberal political obligation, legitimacy of authority greatly depends on the realization of equality-based justice, so meritocracy’s role in liberal societies is determined by its adapting to the comprehensive legitimacy – the combination between utilitarian function of authority and equality-based justice. In this regard, natural duty theory asks meritocracy to further discharge individuals’ duties among each other by reaching a compromise between its utilitarianism and justice consideration. By setting principles for meritocracy from the perspective of egalitarianism, this thesis argues that it is possible to arrive at a compromise between the need of meritocracy and the appeal of social justice. Eventually a merit-based society featured with self-restraint of meritocracy can be achieved, contributing to both the performance-oriented and justice-focused legitimacy of political authority.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In this thesis, I argue that the scholarship on repression has to look at the variation of the means of repression on the subnational level, especially in the case of low-scale, or “soft” repression. Based on the case of the implementation of Article 282 of the Criminal Code in 80 Russian regions, the study aims at defining the key regional factors which determine the differences in how frequent the Article was used in these subnational units. Firstly, I expect that regions with higher degrees of social dissent have more intensive use of repression. This claim is consistent with the existing body of research on the relationship between protests and state repression. Secondly, I propose that the stronger the subnational political machines are, the less repression occurs in the regions. This statement is supported by the literature on subnational authoritarianism and studies of political machines on the local level. Lastly, my quantitative analysis attempts to find how local political regimes influence the frequency of repression implementation. The last hypothesis is supported by recent studies on the diffusion of repression. Unfortunately, the results of the quantitative analysis provide either no or little support for the hypotheses. However, the case studies of Russian regions demonstrate some interesting aspect of regional politics which was not captured by the indicators in the regression analysis. Thus, it leaves prospect for further studies of various forms of repression on the subnational level.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The secularization thesis according to which the modernization process would inevitably bring secularization and decline in religiosity was challenged in light of the religious upsurge in modern societies. Georgia is among the countries which experienced a profound upheaval of religiosity in the public sphere after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the period before and after the declaration of independence conflicting discourses were seeking to influence the formation of the Georgian national identity. Likewise, the legislation on the religions and the Church-state relationship involves conflicting claims. While freedom of religion is enshrined in the legal framework of the country, the Constitutional Agreement of 2002 bestows significant privileges upon the Georgian Orthodox Church. The Church demonstrated multiple times its power to mobilize masses and impact tremendously on the public opinion. This influence equips it with the power to impact the law-making process in the country. Even though one can notice the tension between the Church and the state time to time, the interplay between the two normally presents itself as a cooperation. The research has multiple purposes. First, it aims at providing a legal analysis of the legal framework on the status of the Georgian Orthodox Church and religious freedom. Second, it seeks to explain the influence of the Church on the law-making process. Third, depicting the tension between the Church and the Constitutional Court is one of the main foci of the Thesis. Finally, the thesis provides an assessment of the the legal dimension of Church-state relationship in Georgia through the prism of the doctrine of state neutrality and constitutional secularism. I argue that the lack of coherent and comprehensive legal framework and the discriminatory treatment of the state towards the different religions and confessions in Georgia renders the neutrality of Georgian state as well as declared secularism delusional, thus hampers the modernization and democratization process of the country. On the other hand, the Georgian Orthodox Church does not have a final say on all legal matters pertaining to the social or religious issues. Whereas the executive and legislative bodies largely reflect the popular sentiments, the Constitutional Court seeks to act in a counter-majoritarian manner and upholds the principles of equality and freedom of religion. In addition, various civil and international actors can considerably impact the governmental policies and provide an essential resistance to the initiatives, advocated by the Church. The research suggests that two factors: high social relevance of the particular controversial issues, and the congruence of the public opinion with the Churchâ€™s position _ each often serves as necessary condition for the Church to pass through its initiatives and decisions.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Therefore, the puzzle that liberalism’s basic architecture and secularism as a basic pillar of achieving religious toleration were specifically solutions to specific provincial (European) issues, increases the salience of religion today and demands a reevaluation of the basic tenets of this debate. This thesis argues, that due to certain blind spots in Liberal Political Thought’s (LPT) understanding of religion, LPT’s secularism promises to uphold liberal neutrality (neutrality of the state towards ethical conceptions) universally, however, secularism, due to its Christian-inflicted history and origins, requires a reconceptualization in order to uphold the ideal of liberal neutrality.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Unfortunately,  social  sciences,  including Political Science and International Relations field, are not an exception in this case. The data-sharing practice has become one of the major tools in fighting the replication crisis. The shared data  allows  to  conduct  further  studies,  replicate  previous  work  and  develop  science,  make  it more  transparent  and  reliable.  As  the  journals  have  become  the  central  platforms  for  the academic  discussions,  the  data-sharing  issues  depend  on  the  introduction  and  consistent implementation of the data availability policies by those journals. However, there are several important features that have not been touched and addressed before. One of them is the role of the reviewers and their contribution to the implementation of data availability policies and provision of research transparency in political science. Although some initiatives were started in this direction (like The Peer Reviewers’ Openness Initiative), the  issue  has  not  been  addressed  yetas  a  part  of  the  more  general  debates  on  DA-RT  (data availability and research transparency). The study shows that peer-reviewing, even without the responsibility of replication or verification,  is  already  a  very  time-consuming  and  highly  demanding  unpaid  burden  on  the reviewer’s shoulders. Thus, in general, reviewers do not perceive a need for more involvement in  the  replication  process  since  it  requires  specific  skills,  infrastructure,  efforts  and  time.

The following thesis addresses this broad debate in the domain of post-Soviet party politics. Scholars typically try to explain party systems with societal and institutional (structural) variables. As a result, the role of elite choices (agency) is somewhat neglected. The thesis focuses on six post-Soviet countries and aims to examine structural- as well as agency-approaches. Its contribution can be divided into three parts. Firstly, party systems of six post-Soviet countries are systematically described. Secondly, through the analysis of six post-Soviet countries, this thesis illustrates that societal and institutional factors leave party system differences largely unexplained. This finding is grounded on regression analysis of electoral volatility and associations between various societal and institutional factors on the one hand, and party system fragmentation and stability on the other. Thirdly, the party system of Georgia is focused upon as it is not very different from the other 5 countries in respect to structural factors, but displays markedly dissimilar party system characteristics. Through the analysis of the Georgian case, it is demonstrated how agency can make a difference â€“ i.e. choices of party elite in the middle of 2000s shaped the cleavage structure of society which has had a decisive impact on the party system. These findings are based on secondary literature, expert interviews and most importantly, directed acyclic graphical (DAG) and path models. The latter method relies on survey data and has not been used extensively to examine party-related questions (partly because of its novelty). It is shown how useful such methods can be in addressing questions which reside at the intersection of sociology and party politics.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

International organizations and institutions have by and large adopted “Roma”, and their counterparts in some countries followed suit. This is a largely elite-driven change, and we know little about how members of the majority population react to such a change and why. Understanding reactions can both inform expectations regarding the impact of campaigns for “politically correct” language, and contribute to understanding how social norms change. Drawing from the literature on prejudice, attitude and normative change, as well as the literature on public opinion and communication, this study asks when labels matter, to whom and with what effect. It formulates a series of expectations regarding the interplay between contextual and individual-level factors in shaping reactions. Hypotheses regarding the role of prejudice, motivation to control prejudice and awareness are tested using data from an experiment embedded in a 2015-16 national survey in Romania.  The findings indicate that attitudes toward the group influence how people respond to different labels, with “Roma” eliciting less minority-friendly responses than “Gypsy”. In terms of theory development, I argue that the balance of different forces may depend on contextual attributes. Consistent with this, in the Romanian survey people with different levels of motivation to control prejudice and awareness do not respond differently to the labels, suggesting that if there is a norm against prejudice in Romania, it is not well connected to these wording issues, given its limited visibility and politicization.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The reason for that is that in the context of electoral success of new far-right party ‘Alternative for Germany’ (AfD) on the last parliamentary elections many experts note that there are a lot of Russian-Germans among the supporters of this party. However, the precise level of support of AfD by Russian-Germans is unclear. In this thesis I analyze profiles of Russian-Germans in social media networks and complement these data by the analysis of the GLES 2017 dataset. This research reveals that there is a quite small group among Russian-Germans (primarily men of 50 years and above) who support the anti-immigrant sentiments of AfD. The share of this group constitutes approximately 11%, that is close to the country’s average result of AfD. Thus, the support of AfD by Russian-Germans is not overwhelming as media outlets present. To reveal reasons of such media bias I conduct a comparative analysis of media publications. This analysis shows that different media outlets may have different motives to publish news about a tendency of Russian-Germans to vote for AfD, namely: indirect critique of the Kremlin (the Russian non-state media), promoting of AfD (the pro-Kremlin media), and transferring of responsibility (the Western media). At the same time, such explanations as media bias resulting from the search for a memorable story and the lack of valid information can be further motives for all three categories of media outlets.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In general, the imposition of sanctions pursues three possible goals: to signal, to constrain, and to coerce the targeted state in order to change its objectionable behavior. Existing studies show that the effectiveness of sanctions is largely determined by which type of political regime is targeted. The general consensus in the scholarly literature is that non-democracies are more resistant to sanctions than democratic governments since the former are able to mobilize and redistribute the resources to compensate the sanctions damages and prevent the risks of revolt within (by cooptation) and outside (by repression) its winning coalition. Since 2014, a number of Russian foreign policy actions led to the imposition of sanctions against it by Western countries. Sanctions did not lead to the desired change in Russia's foreign policy, but had a cumulative negative effect on its economy. In the same period the political regime in Russia continued to move towards further autocratization. This thesis analyzes the impact of sanctions on the strategies of repression, co-optation and legitimation which are used by authoritarian regimes to remain in power. Using the process-tracing method, the study shows that sanctions and Russian counter-sanctions led to the shift from the performance-based legitimation towards the model of the ‘besieged fortress’, the weakening of elites oriented towards incorporation into international cooperation and international institutions, and the strengthening of elites oriented towards the further securitization of domestic politics."", 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The case for research is Russia due to its fairly sharply divided political arena that allows to effectively capture variations in political partisanship. Four infographics presenting a non-salient topic of healthcare system funding are designed and firstly tested on the focus groups. Infographics changed accordingly with the focus groups insights are used in the online survey. Sample of 731 university students is analyzed with logistic regression and classification tree model to test the hypotheses. Neither individual’s political partisanship, nor the complexity of the layout have an effect on trust to infographics. However, general trust in information is statistically significant in most of the models. While the research contributes to the understanding of the factors driving trust to infographics, further studies based on the findings discussed here are able to clarify revealed inconsistencies.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The alt-right, a loosely organized network of web-savvy young men, threw its collective weight behind Donald Trump, the politically incorrect, provocative outsider. Though failing to disavow the white supremacist alt-right throughout the campaign, a series of unhooding events following the election brought the movement greater notoriety, forcing the President to condemn his loudest online community. An unhooding event (Atkinson 2018) is an instance that exposes a far-right movement’s potential for violence or connection to neo-Fascism. From 2016 to 2018, following three keys unhoodings analyzed in this study, a decline in movement mobilization is observed. This study utilizes the framing theory of social movements (Benford & Snow 2000) to consider how grassroots members of the alt-right react to an affront to their carefully constructed framing. With explicit connections to violence or Nazism being politically untenable, alt-right participants engage in a metapolitical framing that shields their affinities for violence and fascistic elements (á la Nouvelle Droite or French New Right). In the month following an unhooding event, I mine alt-right online forums for activist’s reactions and find four distinct proposed framing strategies: commitment to the metapolitical, claims of conspiracy, concessions of defeat, and radicalizers. This study provides insight into the internal communications of white supremacist activists; providing a novel perspective on the dynamics of a movement’s decline. To conclude, I question the implications of an unhooded social movement in the social media age.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The thesis argues that the external influences of democratization are not given; incumbents can neutralize both direct and indirect influences of western linkage. Through examination of Hungarian and Turkish cases, the thesis finds that : (1) Incumbents could neutralize direct influences of democratization by decreasing their linkages to the west and increasing their ties to autocratic powers (2) They could neutralize indirect influences through personalized political parties and creation of a minimal winning coalition where the former neutralizes the political elite and the latter neutralizes the economic elite. The analysis is based on testing Levitsky and Way’s (2010) claims on how western linkage provides shapes and incentivızes interests that lead to democratization.

There is a trend of the increasing use of the referendum among the new democracies since the third wave of democratization, while less attention has been paid to the institutional changes of referendums. Most democracies tend to maintain restrictive provision to make the referendum less accessible to the public. Lowering the referendum thresholds rarely happens among the new democracies, especially without the purpose of power abuse. Taiwan seems to be the only case among the new democracies in which the winning party lowered referendum thresholds, not for power abuse. This thesis focuses on the question of why a political party in a new democracy would like to promise to lower the referendum thresholds during the election campaign and fulfill this promise after winning the election. Since there is a lack of literature specifically on the political party’s lowering the referendum thresholds, this thesis generates four hypotheses to explain this question above based on the case study of Taiwan. This thesis starts with an introduction to the case of Taiwan and the core questions this thesis is going to answer. In chapter 2, I clarify the definition of the term “referendum” in this thesis and discuss the types of referendum thresholds and why thresholds matter. In chapter 3, I analyze the existing literature with a focus on parties’ motivation of selecting issues and fulfilling promised ahead and after the election. In this chapter, an overview of relations between the referendum thresholds and the political party is briefly introduced due to the limited existing literature. In chapter 4, I contextualize the case of Taiwan by analyzing the multiple-dimension external conditions. Besides, I generate four hypotheses to explain why the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan proposed the issue of the referendum reform and made a promises to lower the referendum thresholds during the election campaign, and why the DPP moderately fulfilled its commitments despite the risk that the fulfillment of this promise would hurt its governance. In chapter 5, I discuss the impacts and consequences of lowering the referendum thresholds and try to summarize the necessary and sufficient conditions under which lowering referendum thresholds could happen in other democracies. In chapter 6, I conclude by a summary of generated hypotheses and further research ideas.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Deriving from this gap, the thesis tries to answer the following questions: Why do some hybrid regimes change the combination of stability strategies? Why is there a change through the introduction of a strategy towards a new combination? The thesis argues that the threats coming from the masses (vertical threats), the ruling elite, and opposition parties (horizontal threats) affect the survival strategies of hybrid regimes differently. Turkey, as a hybrid regime, is analyzed between 2002-2019 throughout three periods. The findings of the analysis are the following. 1) The combination of the stability strategies is subject to change when the incumbent is challenged by the new horizontal and/or vertical threats. 2) The horizontal threat by the ruling elites leads to the introduction of hard repression and diffuse legitimation strategy towards the ruling elite and the opposition. 3) The horizontal threat by the united opposition leads to the introduction of formal co-optation strategy towards the opposition parties. 4) The vertical threat by the citizens leads to the introduction of diffuse legitimation and hard repression strategy towards the opposition. Overall the thesis shows that vertical and horizontal threats change the way hybrid regimes try to stabilize their rule. In this sense, the thesis suggests scholars and policymakers focus on the dynamic and adaptive nature of the grey zone regimes.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The arguments in the literature can thus be tested beyond the scope in the OECD area by posing the following three main hypotheses. First, what I call the demobilization hypothesis: low-class individuals have lower preferences for redistribution in ethnically heterogeneous countries (H1). Second, labeled as the altruistic bias hypothesis: upper-class individuals have lower preferences for redistribution in ethnically heterogeneous countries (H2). Finally, the common hypothesis present in the literature: ethnically heterogeneous countries have on average lower preferences for redistribution (H3). By relying on the World Value Survey dataset, the hypotheses are tested on an extensive set of countries from all the continents, applying multilevel models with country-level covariates.

Georgia offers a generally attractive environment for investment, but its capacity to attract investment is underutilized. I argue that by focusing on the supply- side bottlenecks, such as, for instance, lack of human capital, scholarship neglects the problem of the lack of demand under uncertainty, which has major negative impacts on the developmental perspectives of emerging economies. A new analytic framework for FDI attraction that addresses these issues is proposed. State-led investment promotion is a key to success as it enables countries to reinforce the benefits of structural reforms by attracting FDI and ensuring the demand for improvement. However, Georgia's state capacity is low and, therefore, Georgia fails to fully utilize its developmental potential. This argument is derived from the analysis of the performance of Georgia’s Investment Promotion Agency. Grave failures, such as institutional turmoil and chronic understaffing undermine its efficacy.

There is no threshold of voter competence for disabled or non-disabled citizens, nonetheless restrictions are in place as such a cut-off point exists for everyone. As the aim of this right deprivation is to avoid harms to the integrity of elections, I contend that it is essential to address considerations on voter competence which do not accommodate, at the moment, people who are affected by disenfranchisement. Not every citizen will be able and/or willing to vote, but there is a great difference between interest and choice to vote and the imposition of a ban on active suffrage because of fears which are to a high extent fueled by no evidence for its legitimate aim and the lack of opportunities that would promote independence in decision-making and ‘valid political opinions’.

Therefore, research on ideological congruence is voluminous and contrasting, including individual level, party level and system level characteristics. However, with this research paper I try to demonstrate that system level variables deserve more attention from scholars, especially the characteristics of the regime. Since experience of democratic governance is often named as one of the main elements affecting different parts of representation, I propose that democratic maturity might affect ideological congruence. After utilizing CSES Integrated Module dataset (IMD) I analyze 34 European parliamentary democracies from 1996 to 2016, to measure the ideological congruence in the region between the voters and representatives by placement of voters and parties on the left-right scale. Multiple linear regression model used in the paper finds statistical significance for the democratic maturity however other factors like electoral systems and degree of disproportionality together with individual level factors- Human Development Index do no show significance.

Finally, I hypothesize that in Congresses with gender descriptive equality, competition makes the productivity of female and male lawmakers similar, while in descriptive unequal Congresses women feel pressured to perform better. I investigate the cases of Brazil and Mexico, two Latin American countries sharing sociopolitical and economic similarities, which adopted gender quotas as early as the 90s’ (Piatti-Crocker, 2019). However, the outcomes in terms of descriptive representation were sharply contrasting. Brazil’s Congress barely changed its gender ratio and only achieved a record of 15% of female representatives in its 2018\'s elections. Meanwhile Mexico, which started from a similar level as Brazil, conquered technical gender parity in Congress by 2018 (IPU , 2019). Therefore, a comparison of the two countries approximates a “most similar systems” test of whether the higher presence of female deputies in Mexico is related to a higher introduction of women and other minorities’ interests in the political agenda and a higher “democratization” of gender roles in the Congress, in comparison to Brazil. Hence my study relates the topics of gender quotas, women\'s descriptive and substantive representation, gendered political activity, and democratization.

Most existing studies in this topic focus either on the national level policymaking, discussing the relations between welfare policies and regime type or ideologies; or on the efficiency of public versus private hospitals in health sector by evaluating the outcomes. The thesis aims to understand SHBY and privatisation in health mainly from the local governmentsâ€™ perspective, analysing how the fiscal survival pressure and political incentives affect the actual health policymaking in local governments in China. Drawing on official statistics, government policies and existing studies, the thesis mainly consider two types of influencing factors, and categorises three types of responses at the subnational levels. While the implementation of this policy requires a lot of resources and efforts, the thesis emphasises that, firstly, for the local governments, the fiscal impact, especially the hard budget constraint from the central government and soft budget constraint to the local public sector, plays the key role in health privatisation policies in China. Secondly, the political incentives, such as the the possibility of promotion by proving the governance performance might also motivate the local governments to promote this policy, however, the effects are not very clear.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Despite the vast literature on state-business relationships (SBRs), the rise of the new high tech sector of the economy challenges the traditional understanding of SBRs. The goal of this research is to find and conceptualize an explanation of SBRs which is relevant for innovation-oriented companies. It is thus a cross-disciplinary study on the intersection of political economy, political regimes and management studies. This research suggests a new typology that defines four possible modes of interaction between two actors: state-capture, business capture, ad hoc symbiosis and coexistence. These types are determined by state and business behavior. The method of research is typology-building on the basis of in-depth interviews conducted during field research in the largest Russian centers of high tech, and supported by analysis of relevant political economy literature. Empirical findings show that sometimes actors change their behavior which leads to the change of SBRs patterns. However, this dynamic is limited by the context and features of subsectors. Further, research finds that the more innovative a business is, the closer its interaction with the state. Generally, business behavior is mostly passive and state behavior is mostly coordinated in Russia.

Several previous studies have found that as a result of the extensive campaign of the government, attitudes towards immigrants (from outside Europe) became significantly more negative in Hungary. The study tries to identify spillovers in attitudes between attitudes towards immigrants and attitudes towards the Roma minority. The study utilizes both quantitative and qualitative methods of empirical inquiry. Changes in views in terms of subgroups of immigrants and the Roma between 2011 and 2020 are uncovered through using the Bogardus scale that measures the social distance between the majority and minorities, respectively. Additionally, multivariate linear regression models are constructed to determine what socio-political factors explain negative attitudes towards these outgroups in 2011 and in 2020. The study provides micro-level mechanisms to explain changes seen on the macro-level through a focus group inquiry conducted in three different locations in Hungary. The results indicate that there was a negative correlational spillover in attitudes caused by the government’s campaign, suggesting that the sudden growth in negative attitudes towards immigrants had the effect of lowering negative attitudes towards the Roma.

This has been mainly provoked by the country’s weak economy, continually suffering from insufficient regular jobs, work compensation packages and policies that ought to provide and protect the welfare of laborers. However, in most cases, migrants escape precarious work only to end up in more precarity, endangering their lives. What’s more alarming is the case for undocumented or irregular Filipino migrants, whose experiences of abuses are more difficult to be heard than regular migrants, and whose rights are most often neglected. Because of the killings of migrant OFWs in the 1990s, Migrante International was conceived as an intermediary pushing for migrant rights and welfare, handling thousands of cases of abuse and advocating for socio-economic reforms in the Philippines. As such, Migrante continuously produces political remittances representing migrants’ voices through its statements online, subsequently constructing the migration problem back home. I probe this construction, including the framing of the capability of movement among undocumented migrants through intermediary discourses of Migrante. Specifically, I look at (1) how intermediary discourses conceptualize the migration problem through framing mobility as capability among Filipino migrants and (2) how such discourses serve as political remittances in the process of democratization back home. I first assess the persistence of the labor export policy in the Philippines, reconstruct the moral argument for migration and analyze Migrante’s discourses using Sen’s and Foucault’s thoughts. I then empirically argue that the migration problem in the Philippines is characterized by lack of health and social security, insufficient policy, logistic and financial aid, migrant rights use and abuse and anti-immigration sentiments and movements in OFWs’ host countries. This is further fueled by government neglect towards stemming and resolving the root problems of migration, attacks on OFW critics and migrant rights activists and disregard for respecting the fundamental democratic experience of the Filipino people. I also claim that Migrante’s discourses serve as political remittances of migrants’ needs and interests, which challenge the participatory system of whatever form of democracy present in the country. Its disposition as progressive and humanitarian also establishes its subject positions as a moral actor interested in truth games concerning the migration problem, heavily shaped by government policies and strategies back home.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Oppositional campaigns of the I. and VIII. districts are explored via semi-structured interviews with campaign members, complemented by the contextual analysis of each district.

The results suggest that political opportunity creation in an ‘unlevel electoral playing field’ (Levitsky and Way, 2001) is possible, through the use of innovative strategies, such as oppositional coordination and intensive personal campaigning, and through the politicisation of both inward- and outward-looking, affective messages. Moreover, this project asserts that given hybrid regimes’ centralised nature, it is on the municipal level of governance that the development of oppositional identities is the least hindered.

SARS pandemic became a challenge for the government from both health and security perspectives, revealing healthcare management's weaknesses. A similar outcome happened during the Ebola outbreak in the countries of Western Africa when people resisted not only disease isolation and controlling measures but also had little belief in the existence of a disease threat. Consequently, in this thesis, I examine the conditions under which the 21st century's world pandemics trigger political violence and civil unrest. By focusing on the state capacity concept, which is widely used for measurement of successful policymaking (Gomide et al., 2018, Patrick, 2006), I demonstrate that low levels of it are connected with the potential risk of violent events. This idea is proved by comparing state capacities related to China's healthcare-related policies during SARS and South Korean ones during the MERS pandemics. More evidence that supports the described pattern is found by analyzing Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra-Leone. According to this thesis's findings, lack of transparency in policymaking, weak intergovernmental coordination, and insufficient communication with society lies in the core of the politically violent events during the health emergency. Nevertheless, the factor that might mitigate the threatening social uprising is foreign assistance and cooperation with the international community from the earliest stages of the disease spread.

First, it investigates the effects of hostile political joke exposure on political attitudes. It is theorized that symmetrical hostile joke exposure increases affective polarization and decreases trust in politicians. Second, the thesis develops a theory of partisan humor bias. It is hypothesized that people evaluate better pro-attitudinal jokes (jokes from co-partisan sources and hostile jokes about out-partisans). Furthermore, it is expected that affective polarization positively moderates joke source effect. It is also hypothesized that jokes with female joke sources are evaluated worse (benchmark for partisan source effect). To test these theories, survey experiments were conducted in a pilot study (N=149) and a second survey (N=796). Hypothesis are tested as part of the experiments of the second survey. The questionnaires were distributed on the survey platform Lucid.io, and respondents received financial compensation. Pilot survey shows that respondents found even soft critical and positive jokes moderately hostile (except a positive meme about Joe Biden). Joke target effects are significant, and partial heterogenous gender effect is revealed in the pilot. Republican males are negatively biased, while Democrat males are positively biased toward female joke sources. Joke target effect is significant in the second survey too, but gender effect does not replicate. Other hypotheses are rejected. The most important finding of this thesis is hostile humor exposure’s effect on affective polarization. It is significant and substantial, but in opposite direction than expected.

Macro level analysis is based on European Value Study (EVS) 3rd pre-release of 2017 data, while for mezzo/micro level analysis I conducted 8 interviews with the members of the new leftist movement. The research reveals that a precarious society was formed by the losers of democratic transition and globalization. The opportunity for the leftist movement to arise was due to disappointment in society, formed by a long-lasting inefficiency of political parties and their inability to deal with precarious conditions in the country. The new leftist movement was formed recently because the new, more liberated generation, sharing both material and non-material values, started to enter the labor market and faced these precarious conditions on their own. Moreover, because of the nature of their value basis, the new leftist movement is dual -- an anti-austerity-care movement, fighting not only for the improvement of the precarious conditions they are facing, but also taking care of most vulnerable ones and thus creating a more inclusive and equal democracy.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

First, the research on terrorism is 'event-driven.' Second, the author's place of belongingness affects their writings. Two original datasets are constructed to recognize if Pakistan's research on terrorism is 'event-driven' and whether Pakistan's authors' nationality impacts their writings. The results suggest that the research on terrorism follows the same pattern in Pakistan as well. Researchers from Pakistan pay overwhelmingly more attention to religious/sectarian terrorism than ethnic violence.

Secondly, it utilizes analysis of variance of the individual-level survey data to demonstrate the effect of institutional trust on confidence in vaccines.

This act eliminated discrimination against certain ethnic groups that had persisted since the Immigration Act of 1924 which established the National Origins Formula. Under the National Origins Formula, immigration quotas were put into place in order to limit the number of immigrants from regions of the world that would negatively alter the ethnic distribution of the United States. The era within which the Hart-Celler Act was passed was one of a great change in the psyche of the U.S. demos towards a more liberal, global way of thinking by removing these quotas and creating a better system through which residency could be acquired. The changing of times and inability to address it since, however, has led to immigration becoming a forefront of political debate in the United States today. This has culminated in the presidential campaign and subsequent election of Donald J. Trump, whose primary campaign issue revolved around racially charged sentiments and the problems of immigration. My aim here is to assess, from relevant data and evidence, the impact of the Hart-Celler Act by examining a) how it improved or faulted as legislation upon its predecessor – via reallocation of immigration slots from Northern Europe to 3rd world inhabitants or the creation of chain migration – and b) the economic and social consequences that have occurred in the fifty years following. I shall follow this up by developing a normative scale upon which to judge the competing immigration theories, which is succeeded by taking a look at philosophical literature in search of providing a clearer picture regarding the moral debate surrounding immigration today. I conclude a) that Congress passed a law improving on many of the shortcomings of its predecessor, though it has not been spared criticism on pragmatic grounds; and b) that the legislative changes cultivated fairly positive economic consequences. Additionally, I assert that sole adherence to either theory of immigration is too narrow in approaching the problem of reform and that collaborative measures that are understanding of both sides’ interpretations of justice is the most suitable path forward.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

These wars tend to produce fast, extensive mobilizations of civilians, yet this reoccurring connection has mostly evaded a systematic analysis. This thesis explains why and how such social structure affects the dynamics of civil war mobilization. Unlike most existing civil war mobilization literature, the theory identifies both prewar and wartime factors, as well as both social groups and armed actors, as the determinants of mobilization. The theory proposes that civil war mobilization is determined primarily by the pre-war social structure and the wartime armed actors’ effects on social structure. The more pre-war social structure rests on cohesive social groups, the more it enables individuals to mobilize in insurgencies effectively. However, the pre-war structure is necessary but not a sufficient explanation for civil war mobilization. When a war starts, armed actors gain a crucial role. Mobilization dynamics during wartime depends on armed actors’ behavior, especially military and political decisions that affect social group cohesion. The horizontal ties of solidarity between group members enable fast and extensive collective action. However, if the armed actors disturb the vertical group status relations, this can change the extent and direction of civilian participation in the war.  To test these propositions, the empirical part of the thesis conducts a micro-comparative historical analysis of the civil war in Montenegro during the Second World War. Empirical analysis shows that the cohesive kinship-based social groups effectively mobilized against the Italian occupation in the early phase of the war. In the second phase, the insurgents’ military and political decisions had disrupted group cohesion, and led to the civil war mobilization that pitted local armed actors against one another.  The mechanisms of participation and recruitment are further explored on a micro-level, in a single county. This analysis presents qualitative and quantitative evidence collected from historical and ethnographic sources, used for the first time in a systematic comparative analysis. It shows that during the 1941 insurgency, tribal groups in Montenegro could mobilize fast and extensively against the outside military force, relying on strong ties between individuals, which existed before the war. The mobilization in the civil war between the local armed actors is attributed to the conflict generated by insurgents reversing the status of cohesive social groups.  The alternative explanations of civil war mobilization are evaluated using several statistical tests, including multivariate regression and survival analysis. The analysis of municipal-level data collected from primary and secondary sources gives additional support to the social structure explanation of civil war mobilization, when pre-war economic, political, and wartime military factors are accounted for.  The evidence presented in the thesis indicates that social structure has a high explanatory potential for what appears as endless civil wars. It offers insights for the study of behavior of insurgent groups during wars, and their relations with civilians. It also invites further research and more comprehensive testing of the theory, in different contexts and with novel data.'}"

It consists of three separate studies that employ Qualitative Comparative Analysis. The first study investigates the factors accounting for the signing of bilateral treaties between Moscow and the Russian regions in the period of 1994-1998. The results of the analysis suggest that President Yeltsin formed a broad coalition with both authoritarian and democratic regional heads by negotiating bilateral agreements with them. This strategy allowed Yeltsin to win the 1996 presidential election, yet in the long run, it had contributed to the preservation of authoritarian enclaves in Russia. These findings demonstrate that in a situation of high political polarization a multi-level territorial setting can push the national executive to interfere with a democratic process. The second study concerns gubernatorial incumbency and analyzes the factors accounting for the reappointment of incumbent governors by President Medvedev between 2008 and 2012. The results support the argument that the incumbents remain in office as long as they fulfill the main ""federal priorities,"" that is, high electoral results and political stability. These findings suggest that being dependent on electoral results, the regional executives not only in the ethnic regions but also in the regions with a predominantly ethnic Russian population have influenced electoral outcomes mobilizing voters on behalf of the regime. Finally, the third study deals with politically sensitive transfers in Russia focusing on the case of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The results of the analysis indicate that the distribution of federal transfers that are sensitive to political bargaining is highly dependent on the political connections of regional elites rather than driven by the consistent strategy of the federal government. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that the regional governments in Russia play an important role in directing the flows of federal transfers. These results suggest that the move towards authoritarian federalism happened in Russia without fully sacrificing political authority of the regional governments. As a result, the multi-level territorial structure even in the authoritarian context causes some uncertainty, engenders certain flexibilities, and provides the power-sharing mechanisms that political actors can exploit.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

My interest begins from one very basic observation. Contemporary accounts aiming at answering “what should be done with border policies?” argue that policies affecting human movement should be more permissive or restrictive. Interestingly, however, neither camp of philosophers, open and closed borders advocates, sufficiently addresses the most essential element at the basis of all forms of migratory projects: what is the value of movement itself? This question not only is not answered in the philosophical migration literature, but it is also not problematized in the first place. Assuming that migration is beneficial to all parties, simply moving in view of lifting borders, may not entail (positive) freedom to move, just as simply marrying may not entail freedom to form meaningful relationships - if counterfactually one is forced by circumstances into marriages that bring about better distributive outcomes to all, and especially to the vulnerable partners. I therefore aim to provide an account of movement, in order to contribute to determining permissible ways to regulate movement: to restrict, protect or promote it. I argue that movement is an essential interest. Humans have an intrinsic interest in movement, similarly to the interest to establish meaningful sexual and intimate relationships. Further, moving to mate, escape predators and find favorable climatic conditions, need not be thought to hold true only in the animal realm. Humans have an instrumental interest in movement as well, although for reasons that are often more complex and less basic (related to survival) – for example, instead of escaping animal predators, humans move to escape dictators. With this leading idea in mind – that movement is intrinsically and instrumentally valuable – I consider the value of movement for underprivileged groups, economic migrants and refugees. In view of the fact that most human movement is voluntary, I argue, policies regulating movement should reflect the moral ideal that people should move out of choice. A holistic policy approach, taking into consideration normative and empirical considerations, is needed to address contemporary conditions under which movement takes place – generally out of need. Upon considering the value of movement, the focus of the theorizing shifts from the main inquiry, which is currently about whether states should restrict or permit movement. I suggest instead to anchor our thinking around movement, more consistently, in liberal and democratic doctrines. Lifting movement restrictions, in my view, is too modest a moral goal, if for instance, a higher moral goal, that of more just movement – movement out of choice – is not achieved. Lifting restrictions will permit more unjust movement, if the poor is ‘stuck’ into perpetually moving out of dire need. My account satisfies sufficientarian and egalitarian accounts of justice, as it engages both trends into considering that just movement should approximate an ideal consistent with the liberal tenets they stem from: everyone should choose whether or not to move. In this work I defended my thesis on sufficientarian premises, but with further argument, I preliminarily see egalitarianism having its way with my core argument as well. Furthermore, it contributes to open borders theories by showing that the case for more permissive and inclusive policies is more consistent with liberal justice, upon reconsidering how we conceive of basic liberties and movement as an essential interest. It contributes to closed borders theories focusing on reasons for movement restriction, such as the value of the community and self-determination, upon considering the value of movement in sedentary communities. If it is true, as I argued, that restrictions are harmful practices, then restrictions are justified only if a holistic policy approach seriously tackles the reasons for contemporary migratory movement – out of need. Restrictions, however, are hardly justified, when movement is undertaken out of choice, and for morally important (and non-malicious) reasons.'}"

To avoid violence, elites strike deals which are acceptable to their interlocutors as well as their own constituencies. In sharp contrast, power-sharing’s newer strand is largely applied in reaction to violence and features elites who hitherto have shown little inclination for self-restraint. Instead of ‘amical agreements’, elites’ consent to post-conflict power-sharing becomes conditioned on third party’s incentives and sanctions. This genesis brings about two major challenges. First, externally engineered agreements pair non-consensual parties with formal institutions requiring moderation. This mismatch is a receipt for immobilism. Second, with consent conditioned on ‘sticks and carrots’, third parties become a surrogate for elite motivation. Once their influence attenuates, frictions arise. This context prompts the question how post-conflict power-sharing agreements can be transformative and facilitate an elite behavior which is congruent with the institutional framework and viable in the absence of third parties.  On a theoretical level, the thesis highlights the interdependency of elite motivation, elite intra-group predominance and institutional safeguards. To relax the inherent tensions, the thesis makes the case for not fully deterministic agreements. Rather than spelling out a final outcome with winners and losers, not fully deterministic agreements are sufficiently ambiguous to bridge the divide across the cleavage but also between elites and their constituency. The negotiation of an agreement becomes diffused from a high-stake moment into an ongoing deliberation. Potentially - but not necessarily -, the underlying incompatibility may become amenable to new solutions. On an empirical level, the thesis investigates Bosnia’s Dayton Agreement and Northern Ireland’s Good Friday Agreement by means of cross-case study research and process tracing. Both agreements were concluded under the strong influence of third parties and feature a comprehensive set of accommodative institutions. However, both have been exhibiting markedly different patterns of elite interaction. While the development of Dayton Bosnia has been typical as to the theoretical expectations (strong intervention results in immobilism and attenuation problem), Northern Ireland featured - despite repeated crises - deviant patterns of elite cooperation and moderation. Notwithstanding each case’s institutional and historical intricacies, the argument is presented that the openness of the Good Friday Agreement as to the future status of the region facilitated the constructive engagement of those initially opposed to the agreement. They did so, however, only once their parties had become the dominant representatives of their segment. In contrast, the elite cooperation under the Dayton Agreement has been largely a consequence of the OHR’s resort to sanctions. With its attenuation, inter-elite antagonism returned with new vigor.  The results stress the need for a more nuanced differentiation between power-sharing as a means to end violence and a means to consolidate peace. Reconciling the requirements of elite motivation, elite predominance and an institutional accommodation can amount to squaring the circle. While there is a limit how far each can be manipulated, not fully deterministic agreements offer a means to expand the room to maneuver.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

Recently a new breed of fiscal institutions were introduced to complement fiscal rules, called independent fiscal councils. The dissertation explores when and how these new institutions can work to fulfill their mandate in the European Union. I argue that the effectiveness of fiscal councils are highly context dependent and cannot be separated from their respective domestic and international institutional environment. In the dissertation I show that in order to have an impact on policy direction, fiscal councils need to be perceived as supporting institutions by the government in order to have their recommendations taken into account. When the government's preferred policy trajectory diverges from the recommended policy actions by the councils they are viewed as adversary institutions and due to a lack of enforcement tools on the part of the fiscal watchdogs their policy advice can be ignored by the government. The effectiveness is also conditional on the presence of external pressure such as the market pressure on the governments and the supranational fiscal framework of the European Union. I find that the reformed European framework does present a considerable amount of peer pressure and the European Commission can serve as an external support for the domestic fiscal councils. I also introduce a novel approach to the field by analyzing the policy network structure in which these new fiscal councils are embedded. I find that their position in the network facilitate their role by having access to the key governmental agencies and ministries.  Combining a case based approach with network analysis I investigate institutional reforms and fiscal policy developments through the cases of Belgium and Slovakia from 1990 to 2018. The two countries provide a diverse set of cases with different levels and complexity of fiscal institutions as the Belgian High Council of Finance is the oldest fiscal council in Europe as opposed to Slovakia which performed an impressive institutional leapfrogging starting in the early 2000's. This methodological approach allows to shed light on how key institutional and political changes impacted fiscal policy. By including Slovakia in the dissertation, the research contributes to the literature by adding a detailed analysis of how institution building affected fiscal policy in a post-transition Central Eastern European member state. Both the case studies and the network analysis relies on original data collected via interviews and institutional surveys.""}"

My dissertation shows why a careful moral consideration of behavioral influences goes beyond the standard nudge debate. I take up a broader approach which assesses whether cultivating and regulating behavioral influences for various purposes can be accommodated within the framework and principles of political liberalism. I call this approach behavioral enhancement. In the dissertation, I engage with three normative concerns at the core of behavioral enhancement: 1.) Under what institutional circumstances is it allowed for governments to nudge? 2.) Should the utilization of behavioral influences in markets be regulated? 3.) Should behavioral influences be used by government to get people to abide by enforceable moral duties? The permissibility of government nudging, as well as the utilization of influences by market agents, is tested against the backdrop of liberal principles, of which personal autonomy is the most considered and explored here. I claim that this moral inquiry requires an account of personal autonomy updated by relevant considerations from the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I develop such an account under two empirical stipulations – pervasiveness of non-reflective behavioral influences and limited reflective resources of individuals. The account suggests that although intentional (as well as unintentional) behavioral influences have the capacity to undermine autonomy, they are also compatible with many individual management styles. The first normative concern of behavioral enhancement engages us most with the standard moral debate on nudging. I particularly address the worry that nudges, as non-transparent influences, cannot be reconciled with democratic principles of publicity and contestation, and cannot respect autonomy if they steer individuals without their consent. I develop a principle of ‘watchfulness’, which establishes institutional conditions for nudge transparency that allow individuals to accommodate nudges into their autonomous pursuits if they agree with them, or circumvent them without much burden if they do not. The second normative concern starts with the observation that standard moral objections to government nudges should make us a lot more wary of influences by marketers. This is because these influences are not curtailed by principles of government nudging (mildness and sensitivity to agent preferences), and are more likely to overwhelm agents by virtue of sheer numbers. I lend further normative support to this observation, and recommend policy solutions for influences by marketers. The third normative concern takes the first step in exploring the extent to which influences should be used to facilitate moral behavior. Here, I limit my advocacy of moral influencing on getting people to discharge duties that are either enforceable or non-enforceable due to feasibility constraints. I address worries that such influences promote mere conformity with duties, and that they stifle moral disagreement. The last chapter explores nudging to promote charity giving, which I claim is a case where the balancing of different duties – respect for autonomy and alleviation of poverty – is uncertain.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

In looking at this process in post-Milošević Serbia, the guiding question in this dissertation is how political and business actors and their ties influence the dynamic of renationalization and what the mechanisms are in this process. Illiberal trends of renationalization became widespread across post-communist countries in the last decade, but we still know little about the nature of this phenomenon and its political roots. Although the existing state capture approach has some analytic capacity to analyze renationalization, its predominant focus on business actors neglects the role of political actors in this process. Rather than a priori assuming primacy of any actor, I argue for the need to map out the micro-level interactions of political and business actors involved. In doing so, I relied on an original longitudinal dataset of 125 big strategic Serbian firms privatized between 2002-2011 and on semi structured elite interviews with oligarchs, CEOs, bureaucrats, politicians and investigative journalists. I argued that two forms of embeddedness of firms influence their likelihood of renationalization: political and ownership embeddedness. I proxied political embeddedness as the presence of political officeholders on firms’ Board of Directors (BOD). Regarding ownership embeddedness, I considered differences in the business and relational capacity of domestic businesses and distinguished between corporate owners, those having profitable corporations and/or a developed network of corporate relations, and second level domestic owners, who lack these capacities. The quantitative analysis in this dissertation, based on Cox proportional hazard model, showed that politically connected firms have a higher likelihood of renationalization than nonpoliticized firms and that firms owned by corporate domestic owners are less likely to be renationalized than those owned by second level businesses. The qualitative analysis explored the logic of these findings. I found that renationalization in politically connected firms occurs either as an unintended consequence of extraction: when incentives for purchasing a firm relate to extractive opportunities which a firm enables, or as a consequence of predation, when various actors, including political parties, businesses, local administration and regulatory bodies collude to exert pressure on private owners to take over their firms. The lower likelihood of renationalization for corporate domestic owners compared to second level domestic businesses happens because corporate owners have a business and/or relational capacity to provide informal benefits to political actors, in exchange for avoiding renationalization of their firms. The findings in this dissertation advance the literature on state capture, by, first, recognizing that renationalization is not a unidirectional but multirelational phenomenon, and second, by identifying the relevance of political parties and partisan allegiances in the dynamic of renationalization. Conceptually, this dissertation offers novel findings regarding modalities of renationalization by looking at the micro-level dynamic of this process and at the incentives of political and business actors. Empirically, this study is one of the first attempts to understand the political foundations of renationalization from a micro-level perspective and the first study focusing on any Western Balkan country.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2454k)'}"

This case selection is justified by the fact that both parties have been forerunners in their national party systems in terms of adopting new decision-making mechanisms that rely on the Internet, however, they have implemented such mechanisms based on different conceptions of intra-party democracy (plebiscitary vs. assembly-based). The thesis relies on party statutes, party documents, party websites, and media reports of party events; semi-structured qualitative interviews with party representatives (n=28); and two online membership surveys conducted by the author (n=187 [M5S] + 176 [Podemos]) to reveal the extent to which new forms of participation within political parties as exemplified in Podemos and the Five Star Movement grant power to ordinary party members and supporters, and the way this affects intra-party democracy (RQ). The thesis also uses data from the Political Party Database Project (PPDB) to compare these cases with other parties within the same party systems. Besides exploring the effect of participatory innovations on intra-party democracy, the thesis also addresses the theoretical debate regarding whether more inclusive structures inevitably lead to the hierarchization of political parties, in line with the predictions of Michel’s “iron law of oligarchy” (Michels 1911) and the cartel party literature. The thesis has four main findings. The first is that organizational structure is the chief determinant of intra-party democracy, regardless of the participatory tools that are implemented. The lack of intermediary organs makes it much easier for the party administration to control and manipulate membership ballots, as well as to act as an agenda-setter. Second, the role of the party leader has severe implications on the extent to which the tools that are meant to foster intra-party democracy achieve their stated goals. While charismatic leaders can dominate decisions in almost any organizational setting, not institutionalizing their leadership makes them substantially less accountable and responsive. Members have more influence vis-à-vis charismatic leaders who are replaceable, even if these leaders use sophisticated agenda-setting techniques to constrain their choices. Third, online decision-making tools are more accessible, but not necessarily more conducive to intra-party democracy than their offline counterparts. Moreover, complicated tools and processes might still be subject to the “digital divide”. Online policy-making instruments are a promising avenue for fostering citizens’ participation but so far have failed to generate meaningful results due to the lack of feedback and mediation. Fourth, party activists display higher levels of commitment to the party when they also have regular offline meetings. This suggests that even if online tools are a promising way to engage a larger number of citizens in party work, these need to be balanced by face-to-face meetings to offer a satisfying social experience. More comparative work is needed to demonstrate whether these findings hold for a broader universe of cases.'}"

The analysis is based on the films produced in the period between 2001 and 2014. While literature on post-Yugoslav cinema is abundant, little has been written about the role films play – or have the potential to play – in shaping collective memory. Inspired by the adverse reactions fiction films frequently caused in public, this dissertation started from the following question: what was it that these films “do” – or were perceived to do – to the story of the war? This was then broken down into two research questions: as a point of departure, I looked into whether the war was present in contemporary Croatian cinema, i.e. whether films offered material with regard to the war. Further, if the war was present, how was it addressed – a question that required probing for a suitable explanatory framework. A theoretical framework was built on the literature on collective memory, enabling me to observe the filmic texts as potential artefacts of cultural memory, which offer narrative interventions into the dominant memory narrative of the ‘Homeland War’. A further assumption was made regarding the nature of this dominant narrative: in the heavily memory-saturated environment of contemporary Croatia, the story of the war developed by political officials during the war evolved into a narrative of political memory through active production, media control and occasional use of force to silence dissonant narratives. This then also became a schematic narrative template for shaping further memory of the war – thus mostly excluding dissonant stories from national memory. To answer the first question, thematic analysis was conducted on a preliminary data body, including all feature fiction films made in the period between 2001 and 2014 that were produced, or majority co-produced in Croatia. The ‘Homeland War’ was identified as a prominent topic appearing in four different ways, thus constituting the second data body, consisting of four groups of films in which the war was present as a topic (major, minor, background or silent). In the second stage of analysis, I explored the dialogical relations between films dealing with the war and the dominant memory narrative (in its extrapolated core/narrative template form), observing the different strategies films take in their responses. In doing so, and to understand the film-memory dynamic, I adapted Bakhtin’s concept of hidden dialogicality as read by Wertsch (2002). Through the analysis, the dissertation found three groups of films with regard to their strategies of engaging with the dominant memory narrative. First, films dealing with the past, which dialogically challenge the dominant narrative, reject it through failed polyphony or trauma-silence, or affirm the dominant narrative. Second, films bypassing the past by focusing on the present, depoliticizing and challenging the dominant narrative limitedly. Finally, films assuming the past, which provide cues for a particular war narrative to be “written in,” thus maintaining or subverting the dominant narrative. These findings cast a new light on how fiction films in Croatia address the ‘Homeland War’, enhancing the understanding of the role films play – or can play – in shaping collective memory, and vice versa. This opens the way for future research with regard to both cinema and memory, but also narrativity and memory more generally. It also reveals the need for a more systematic understanding of relationship between narratives and memory in post-war context, not just from the perspective of cultural or memory studies, but political science as well.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2057k)'}"

This dissertation focuses on the dynamics between collective mobilization and its consequences. On the one hand, it investigates whether mobilization influences policy outputs and agendas, and what role contextual factors such as public opinion and elite support play in this relationship. On the other hand, it inquires into reverse causality asking whether policy change affects mobilization in turn. The theoretical and empirical chapters in this dissertation approach this dynamic phenomenon from different angles. Chapter 2 develops the conceptualization and measurement of collective mobilization as public claim making, and introduces the machine-coded protest event data (GDELT) used in the subsequent empirical analyses. Chapter 3 introduces a comprehensive typology of the consequences of mobilization, trying to put distinctions into a common framework. This typology is used for specifying the scope of the empirical analyses which are focused on analysing two  specific types of consequences of mobilization: policy outputs and policy agendas. Next to that, this chapter also proposes a new dynamic model of representation, bringing together the impact of public claim making, public opinion, and elite support on policy outputs and agendas.  Within two issue areas, the environment and education, the dynamic model of representation was empirically tested using a large scale sample of 26 EU countries across a large time span (2002-2013). Chapter 4 looks into the effects of public claim making and its interactions with contextual factors on policy outputs in the form of public expenditure, while Chapter 5 focuses on consequences on policy agendas measured in two ways: governmental events in the media, and legislative activities. The results of both chapters suggest that mobilization does matter for policy. Large-scale increases in mobilization for issues generally correspond to large-scale shifts in policy outputs and agendas addressing those issues. Nevertheless, this is not a simple process. Collective mobilization interacts with both public opinion and elite support for issues in opposite ways. While public opinion support appears to be a catalyser of this impact, elite support seems to reduce collective mobilisation's effects.  Extending the empirical  findings, Chapter 6 illuminates the differences in protest events and the wider array of public claim making events. It shows that while the difference between using a wider range of public claims compared to just protest events is not always critical, for issue areas where protest events are few, using only such events can underestimate the influence of mobilization on policy outputs.  Finally, Chapter 7 focuses on reverse causality in the relationship between mobilization and policy outputs. The effects of policy change and public opinion on intentions to engage in protest participation are analysed using experimental survey data.

The number of hours on the job is not only related to the effort people exert at work, but also determines the time that she or he has left to pursue other activities in life. Therefore, work time is an important measure of well-being and quality of life. Contrary to John Maynard Keynes’ 1930 prediction, economic prosperity has not brought about a dramatic shortening of the work week in the developed world. Today, with an increasing number of full-time workers working more than 50 hours per week and an increasing number of involuntary part-timers, the reconciliation of work and life is far from being achievable for many people in the advanced West. This dissertation examines different aspects of the prevalence of very long, or extreme, weekly work hours in Western European and North American societies. Empirically, it documents diverging patterns of extreme work hours across Europe since the 1970s, using a novel meta-database of extreme work hours. Whereas in France and Scandinavia, the proportion of extreme work hours remained relatively low, in most other European countries it has radically increased. Theoretically, the dissertation proposes three major contributions to existing political economy literature. First, in Chapter II, it provides a macro-institutionalist argument against the neoclassical, or supply-side, point of view on the drivers of long work hours in post-industrial labour markets. It demonstrates that the choice whether to work long hours is not entirely, or even mainly, left to the preference of the individual. Instead, individual choices are constrained by labour market policies, collective bargaining institutions, and new labour market structures, the pattern and trends of which do not necessarily follow the contours of the welfare regime typology. Second, in Chapter IV, through a micro level analysis, the dissertation argues that extreme work is an important obstacle in the maturing of the female revolution. The high prevalence of very long work hours among the full-time employed makes it difficult for women to pursue the dual ambition of career and motherhood for two main reasons. First, as it is hard to reconcile the needs of children with an extreme job, many women self-select themselves into occupations below their skills in exchange for a better work-life balance. Second, women with an extreme worker partner face an elevated risk of falling in the long-term trap of part-time employment or inactivity. This translates into major losses of productive forces at the macro level. Third, in Chapter V, using extreme work as an instrument to measure changes in labour market structures, the dissertation argues that the rise in top income concentration is deeply rooted in structural changes in the labour market. Post-industrialism has restructured labour markets in a profound way, giving rise to a qualitatively different high-skilled labour market segment, a ‘winner-take-all’ segment, in which the constellation of weak labour representation and fierce competitive pressures has given rise to new type of vulnerabilities and unprecedented income inequalities among workers.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1926k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The goal of a militant democracy has been to oppose anti-democratic attempts at dismantling democratic institutions through fundamental rights restrictions (e.g. freedom of speech, freedom of assembly). While much of the literature has been descriptive analysis by comparative constitutional lawyers and political scientists, others have approached the question in a more philosophical way. Contemporary political theorists ask whether the anti-democratic, illiberal nature of militant democracy can be reconciled with democracy. Theorists believe that democratic states do have a right to defend themselves from internal threats which seek to dismantle a democratic way of life, however, they often point to militant democracy’s paradoxical nature and attempt to limit the costs associated with rights restrictions. What has been missing from the literature is an overall normative defense of this institution. This thesis provides such a normative defense and posits a novel model, based on two-levels of justification: the principled level and the political-institutional level. The normative defense of militant democracy lies in its goal: to protect the underlying liberal-democratic values, principles, and norms: moral equality, respect, and toleration. Understanding the goal of militant democracy in this light provides a sound theoretical framework by which to analyze why, whether, and to what extent, militant measures can be used to combat threats to a liberal-democratic state.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1299k)'}"

It might appear none. For many agree that there is no global authority to coordinate compliance with the duty. Hence, it is up to individual agents to decide how to comply. If this is the correct account of the duty to create just institutions, then it seems that significant global justice projects depend on insignificant duty to realize them. The states’ duty is underdetermined, however, only on the supposition that authoritative institutions are necessary to secure coordination among different agents. The dissertation challenges this fundamental assumption in two steps. First, I investigate the practical relevance of conventions for solving coordination problems. By building on the works of Hume and Lewis, I show how individuals in the state of nature could have coordinated their actions by conventions up until a point when a government could have emerged. I identify relevant similarities between conventions creating a government and international customary law. Moreover, I argue that international customary law is a global governing convention since it prescribes how rules that bind all states are to be made. The second step in my argument concerns the normative assessment of conventions. I argue that conventions are essential for demands of justice as long as they enable compliance with the demands. Not all conventions, however, do so. I put forward the principle of salience to identify those practices that play such a role. The salient practices determine the states’ duty to create a just world order. Ceteris paribus, the duty is not underdetermined after all. Consequently, current coordination problems that arise among the states should not be seen as a normal consequence of states’ rational and self-interested behavior in the absence of a global authority; instead, the coordination problems amount to the violation of the duty to create a just world order. The major implication of the argument is that we should replace the Hobbesian framework for thinking about the nature of states as well as how they relate to one another by the Humean one. Thus, instead of insisting on a state’s consent and necessity of a centralized authority to coordinate actions, we should pay more attention to the habitual behavior of states as well as the role conventions play in solving coordination problems among them. Importantly, the relevance of conventions to compliance with moral demands does not make authoritative institutions obsolete. The argument of this dissertation is modest – it only asserts that conventions can coordinate actions in the process of transitioning toward more centralized forms of global authority. As opposed to the pessimistic outlook of the Hobbesian framework, the Humean one makes room for hope that the change of the present unjust conditions is possible.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1615k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The encompassing question is, how do political economy factors shape innovation policy? The central research question is, why did Turkish R&D policy change in the 2000s, and what political economy factors did affect the process? After engaging in a dialogue with the political economy of innovation scholarship, the thesis kicks-off with the assertions that politics matter in the study of innovation, and innovation policy-making is a multi-faceted process. Then, by relying on the theoretical arguments and insights of scholarly works that specialize in technological nationalism, developmental state, and clientelism, the thesis adopts a comprehensive framework for the analysis of R&D policy-making processes in Turkey. Each of the three scholarships focuses on a different layer of policy-making. And then, each empirical chapter zooms into a different dimension of R&D policy in Turkey in the light of the analytical framework adopted.  The thesis relies on multiple sources and triangulation while making its core arguments. In specific, the thesis relies on 26 face-to-face semi-structured interviews (expect for the one which was conducted over the phone) with bureaucrats and relevant stakeholders in Turkey in different intervals between October 2014 and June 2016. In line with the thesis’ primary motivations, interviewees are selected from leading innovation agencies in Turkey. Main governmental and organizational policy documents, laws and regulations, and parliamentary discussions on key R&D legislation, are other important sources of information.  The thesis supports a growing body of work on the politics of innovation policy by demonstrating the importance of the political realm in the study of innovation. The thesis also underlines the opposition parties’ role in R&D policy-making –a rather overlooked channel of influence in the scholarship. In this regard, the thesis argues that technological nationalism, and the opposition’s institutional weaknesses in policy-making, can potentially influence R&D policy by hindering the effective formulation and implementation of alternative policy options. This is found out to be crucial in the Turkish context.  The thesis also offers potential contributions to the Turkish political economy scholarship. Among the essential ones, and besides the argument on technological nationalism and the weak opposition, the dissertation claims that (i) the executive’s continuous interferences with autonomous innovation agencies have influenced R&D policy in many ways in the 2000s in Turkey; (ii) rather than clientelistic relations (akin to the ones that are observed in the construction and the media sector in Turkey), a neo-populist approach has characterized the main rationale in R&D fund allocation to the private sector; and (iii) despite some positive steps undertaken, the Turkish state has yet to embody the essential traits of the ‘developmental state’ in the R&D sector. These findings speak to the broad scholarship on the Turkish political economy in important ways, and offer potential contributions via an in-depth elaboration of the R&D sector.'}"

According to this model, disadvantageous disability arises when social arrangements are tailored to the needs of individuals with typical characteristics, while people with atypical features are left out from these arrangements. Hence, those with atypical features need personalized resources tailored to them, perhaps even have their social and/or material environment changed in line with their atypical characteristics. I argue, however, that not all claims of persons with atypical characteristics merit accommodation, as it would be simply impossible to provide personalized resources for everyone or modify the environment to accommodate everyone’s needs. In other words, these human variation claimants must be “reasonably accommodated.” Nevertheless, there are some social groups whose members have a justifiable claim to receive such reasonable accommodation and religious and cultural groups will be potentially among them for two specific sociological reasons. The negative argument of the thesis highlights why we cannot use conscience, or conscientious objection as a ground to justify religious/cultural claims where it is important for the justification to accommodate claimants as members of religious/cultural groups qua groups rather than isolated individuals, that is, where the group-aspect of accommodation is essential. The upshot of this critique is that conscience is neither necessary, nor sufficient for accommodations where the group-aspect is relevant, such as human variation cases.  The dissertation also responds to possible intuitive objections to the human variation argument. The first opposes the HVM on the grounds that physical disability is bad at the personal level, unlike religious conduct or a cultural practice. I will respond to this objection by criticizing the shortcomings of Guy Kahane’s and Julian Savulescu’s disability model that defends such a view. The second intuitive objection points out that there is a fundamental difference between disability and religious/cultural conduct: the former is by definition not under the control of the individual, whereas the latter is at least physically alterable by religious individuals or followers of cultural traditions. Against this objection, the thesis points out that accommodation provides autonomy to human variation claimants in order not to be deterred from making important personal choices. By examining this problem, the thesis delves into the “luck egalitarian” question – the relation of luck egalitarianism to the question of accommodation as human variation.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1091k)'}"

In political science the left-right space, where the difference between parties is the distance between them on that one continuous dimension, is the most common way to think about political space and measures based on this space dominate empirical research. The left-right metaphor has a long cultural history and therefore it makes sense to assume that a left-right dimension captures the relevant differences among parties. In contrast, there is a range of research, which argues that political spaces are multidimensional and changing across countries and time. The left-right measure is used, most likely because of its simplicity, but it is also contested. The space of party differences is a perceptual space -- it is about how people see and understand those differences. There are no party differences that are separable form people's judgement about them. According to the theory of conceptual spaces, the preferred way to analyse such spaces is pairwise comparison. The difference between objects can be evaluated in pairs and these can either be used as measures in themselves or analysed further. Such measurement gives an estimate of difference that covers all possible dimensions in political space and thus allows us to uncover the dimensions that people -- voters or politicians -- use to differentiate between parties without influencing such judgements with pre-given benchmarks. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons can also be used on their own as many applications of measures of party politics -- in coalition formation, polarisation research and analysis of party change -- do not require an estimate of party position as such, just the distance between them.  The current work shows how pairwise comparisons of parties can be used as a way to uncover people's perceptions of political space on the individual level and how pairwise comparisons of party manifestos through the index of similarity can be used as a direct measure of political difference in models that would otherwise rely on differences measured through the left-right dimension. The individual level analysis is based on survey data obtained from Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The index of similarity based on the manifesto data set is compared to measures of party position on left-right dimensions derived form the same data in models for predicting coalition formation, party system polarisation, and change in the political profiles of parties. The individual level analyses show us aspects of political space that other similar research has not uncovered and those based on the manifesto data set indicate that the pairwise index of similarity outperforms the left-right measures in these contexts. A pairwise comparison of the political profiles of parties is thus a promising way to analyse party politics."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2162k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Who are they, why are they successful, and what happens next? These are the three main questions addressed in this dissertation. Conceptually, it starts with an ideational definition, according to which populism is to be found in the realm of ideas. It combines praise of common people as a virtuous, homogeneous group, a belief in absolute popular sovereignty in politics, and despise of evil, conspiratorial elites. Based on that, theories suggest that the basic reason for these actors' success lies on an erosion of perceived legitimacy of state institutions. Multiple causes have been presented, which can lead to such a loss of confidence: political and economic crises, endemic corruption, elite collusion, and large-scale social transformations, to name a few. On the other hand, consequences of populism, especially at the attitudinal level, have been scarcely studied. Some have suggested that it might increase even more one's distrust in political institutions, it might influence participation, and can have an impact on tolerance. Research on this area, however, is still in its infancy. This thesis uses several methods to address these issues. In the first empirical chapter, I use content analysis to classify electoral manifestos and candidates' speeches from 146 parliamentary parties in 28 countries, mostly between 2010 and 2015, on a scale of how populist they are. These include most countries in Western Europe, South and North America. The next chapter turns to causes. With fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), I analyze what is behind populists' success across those cases at the country-level. Findings point out two combinations of conditions: high corruption in Latin American democracies, and elite collusion in European ones. I proceed by testing these causes at the micro-level, using data from the World Values Survey for a sample of those countries (23). At the individual level, the best predictor of support for more populist parties is lack of trust in political institutions. From that, the next part investigates consequences. With similar models, we observe that populism seems to also decrease political trust, and has some impact on participation. Moreover, right-wing populism appears to cause an increase in intolerance. Given the importance of political trust on both sides of the coin, some pages are dedicated to disentangle the relationship between it and populism. I start by investigating this relation among populists in power, with a comparative case study of Bolivia and Ecuador. I find that elected populist leaders adapt their discourse to target actors who can be credibly framed as elites, remaining anti-elitist. And so do supporters, who follow leaders in redefining the elite and remain anti-establishment while being in favor of the government. Last but not least, I use various methods and data sources to identify the direction of causality between populism and trust as attitudes. Results indicate that, rather than a causal connection, the two seem to be manifestations of a common, more fundamental, psychological attribute. This thesis approaches the populist phenomenon from different sides, and concludes with recommendations on how to identify such actors, the contexts in which they rise, and what to expect once they are there."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1544k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Why do democratic governments not institute policies to alleviate such gaps? Political economy scholarship posits that people’s demands for redistribution are key to the introduction of such policies. This scholarship is often concerned with income differences between the rich and the poor but has little to say about how other cleavages come into play. Therefore, this dissertation explores how people’s demands for redistribution are affected by the presence of income gaps. In this dissertation, it is argued that based on income gaps, people form beliefs about their own economic opportunities and inequality in opportunity more generally. However, since people do not usually have access to sufficient information to form accurate beliefs about inequality in opportunity, they only hold accurate beliefs about their own economic opportunities. While people both reject unequal opportunities (inequity-aversion) and seek to maximize their well-being (self-interest), having inaccurate beliefs about the first has the consequence that people’s redistributive preferences only serve to maximize the returns from their own opportunities. Therefore, redistributive preferences are more polarized in those democracies where income gaps are larger and opportunities more unequal. This polarization makes it harder for political actors to build coalitions around redistributive policies, undermining progressive policy change.  To support these arguments, this dissertation explores the formation of redistributive preferences comparatively, in a total of 21 Western democracies, including the United States and various Central and Eastern European countries. Most empirical chapters are based on secondary data sources and explore how both objective measures and subjective beliefs about inequality in opportunity can explain differences in redistributive preferences. The advanced arguments are further supported through an online survey experiment, which finds that information on income gaps strengthens the workings of inequity-aversion. Finally, a cross-country analysis shows that the suggested effect of polarization due to inequality in opportunity on governmental redistribution is robust to various alternative explanations.  In sum, this dissertation demonstrates how a closer incorporation of social cleavages into existing political economy frameworks can enhance our understanding of dynamics of inequality and redistribution in democracies.

Specifically, this dissertation is concerned with how differences in elite and mass polarization mediate the effects of conflicts, verbal attacks and negativity among partisan elites on support for the political system. I find that it is not the frequently loathed conflict-rich talk of politicians in itself that raises negative feelings among the citizens about the political system and the actors. Rather, the effect occurs when differences in polarization between political elites and their followers are especially pronounced. Thus, the dissertation contributes to the political communication literature by identifying the condition under which negativity, disagreements and conflict-rich talk among politicians creates negative citizen attitudes towards how democracy works. The implication is that it is not the natural tendency of the democratic process to generate visible displays of elite conflict that makes citizens dislike democratic politics, but when it coincides with an apparent oversupply of ideological polarization among elites relative to how much citizens themselves get divided on an ideological basis. Chapter 2 uses three waves of European Election Study (EES) data to show that elite polarization increases how conflictual EU-related news are prior to a European Parliament (EP) election. Chapter 3 uses a dataset on university students in 24 countries prior to the 2014 EP election and finds that when citizens are more polarized, the same campaign debate is perceived as being less negative by them. Chapter 4 again uses EES data to examine the main empirical argument of the dissertation. It finds that in countries where elites are more polarized than the electorate, support for the political system is more strongly undermined by exposure to explicit conflicts between politicians than elsewhere. Finally, in Chapter 5, based on a survey of a representative sample of the online population in a country with a clear disconnect between elite and mass polarization on EU issues, I test whether conflictual rhetoric in such contexts in fact hurts popular support for democracy as the previous findings suggest. In general, the dissertation partly supports and partly complements the elite integration theory outlined by John Higley (most recently in 2010), namely that strong elite divisions bring uncertainty and decreasing support among citizens for the entire political system. The dissertation shows that when partisan elites are divided to a larger extent than their supporters in the electorate, even less harsh debates are seen by citizens as more conflictual, and this decreases political support. However, my results also show that when elites differ little from the masses in how politically polarized they are, or when masses are more polarized, citizens are less sensitive to expressions of elite debates, perceive less negativity in politics, and their support for regimes does not decrease significantly when exposed to signs of elite conflict. These results support that citizens react to elite behavior: when citizens have to listen to endless elite disagreements and conflict-rich talk on a particular issue in which they are more or less united, this bothers them, and they articulate their distaste in the form of decreasing political support for the system that produced these endless disagreements.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2582k)'}"

This dissertation investigates patterns of corruption risks in four high value public procurement markets and in one market between Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. It assesses the driving actors, dynamics of issuer and winner networks, and the organization principles of political and business capture, as well as clean organizational behavior, between 2009 and 2012, before and after the government change in 2010.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (4829k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

How knowledge gains can influence politically relevant outcomes is a frequent question in the study of citizensâ€™ political behavior, and the answers vary considerably across political contexts and across studies. This thesis offers an in-depth investigation of the origins of this variation in electoral democracies spanning the globe. In doing so, it builds on insights from an eclectic range of research fields from survey methodology and measurement theory, to cognitive psychology and comparative politics. First, I show that a selection of technical properties of questionnaire items can account for more than half the variation in the reliability of knowledge measurements. I demonstrate that this can drastically affect the ability of political knowledge to explain outcomes of interest for political scientists. However, I find that the perils of measurement error can be circumvented by modeling techniques previously proposed for estimating information effects on vote choice (Bartels, 1996; and Delli Carpini and Keeter, 1996). The outcome of interest is regressed on political knowledge, a set of demographic variables and all the possible interactions between knowledge and the other variables in the model. By subtracting the expected value of the outcome variable from the same statistic under conditions of maximum political knowledge for every respondent, a total effect of political knowledge can be estimated. As it was previously suggested that most of the effect of knowledge on political preferences occurs via indirect causal pathways (Zaller, 1992), interactive models are expected to better approximate the true effects of knowledge, compared to models that only estimate a direct effect. This claim, however, has not been tested prior to this dissertation. The empirical tests in the final substantive chapters of this thesis compare the two modeling approaches: the complex model with multiple interaction terms and the simple model with only a direct effect of knowledge included. In Chapter 3 I argue that the impact of knowledge on vote choice should be contingent upon the simplicity of the decision task (Lau et al., 2008). A meaningful decision in an election where there are few and easily distinguishable political alternatives does not require any amounts of expertise, thus information effects are expected to be weak. In Chapter 4, I argue that people develop positive attitudes towards the political system either by learning its virtues, or by having an affective attachment to their political community. In small, unitary countries, where there are few and easily distinguishable political parties, little knowledge is necessary for citizens to develop positive attitudes towards the system. I find more support for all these theories using the more complex interactive model, but the direct-effect model performs remarkably well in most cases. This thesis offers ample evidence of information effects on political behaviors and attitudes in a wide range of electoral democracies across the globe. It corroborates findings previously reported in the literature, and demonstrates the ability of political institutions to mitigate information effects on vote choice, turnout, political efficacy and satisfaction with democracy. It also challenges the highly influential assertion that political knowledge has a primarily indirect effect on political preferences."", 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1365k)'}"

Why do nurses, doctors and teachers organize protest action despite their tradition of being quiescent? Based on the analysis of eight conflict events in four countries - Hungary, Estonia, Ireland and Denmark, over the period 1999-2014 - I explain public sector labor unrest trough the concepts of marketplace power, sovereign power and discursive power. First, I challenge the prevailing view in comparative political economy that associates labor militancy with a protected (sheltered) status of employees from the market. Instead, I claim that in a large part of the sector – health care – employees challenge the status quo relying on their strong position on the market. I borrow the notion of marketplace power from Beverly Silver, but refine it based on the least likely event of junior doctors’ resignation campaign in Hungary in 2011. I apply the marketplace power argument to three other conflict events in health care, which followed a similar pattern despite large differences in the institutional environment.Marketplace power is the source of employee-initiated conflict, but sovereign power provides the most coherent explanation of employer offensives. The state uses its sovereign power as a legislator and as a policymaker to terminate institutional compromises with public sector unions, who call defensive protest in response. The least likely case of the Danish school lockout in 2013 demonstrates the sovereign capacity of the state to challenge strong unions. The sequence of labor protest and patience in the wake of austerity measures in Ireland shows how governments can use their sovereign power not only to provoke conflict but also to curb it. While I explain the eruption of conflict with the notions of marketplace power and sovereign power, I also bring in the concept of discursive power to understand the outcomes of conflict. Discursive power denotes the ability to frame disputes in a way that convinces patients, parents and the general public that their interests are also served by employee protest. By identifying these three concepts of power and by teasing out the ways in which they lead to conflict and influence the result of conflict, I contribute to the political economy and the social movements literature. I also provide new insights to practitioners on the chances and risks of protest in a quiescent era of employment relations.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (4920k)'}"

Performing germline modifications on currently living individuals targets future generations’ health and the well-being associated to it by reducing the diversity of the human gene pool. I provide a definition of enhancement that does not only capture the core of the concept itself, but it also distinguishes it from treatment and prevention. I identify four main areas in which genetic enhancement may come to influence the lives of the future people: (i) collective action problems; (ii) impact on global risks; (iii) utopic singularity; (iv) social configuration. As far as social justice is concerned, I propose allocating enhancing vouchers to all the members of a society, including children and the yet unborn. By looking at the effects of individual enhancements on the larger social group, I recommend the subsidization of those procedures that bring the greatest collective gains.

Non-voters are found to be mainly the poor, those coming from minority groups, the less educated, and younger members of the electorate (Verba and Nie, 1972; Verba et al., 1978, 1995; Gallego, 2007). If the structure of active participants is systematically biased towards certain political groups, the allocation of power can also be biased. Unequal participation can lead to unequal influences. This dissertation provides an empirical test of this proposition and asks whether inequalities in political representation follow from inequalities in political participation? To answer this question I have focused on the group of citizens whose rates of participation are evidently unequal, but whose relationship to politics has not only spurred academic attention, but has also received a central spot on the political and media agendas in the majority of established democracies: young people. The study of the consequences of young people’s unequal participation in the decision-making process is a perfect litmus test of the status of political equality in contemporary democracies. In addition, following the normative accounts of political representation, I focus on two components of represen- tation and analyze the impact of young peoples participatory inequalities on their policy preference and interest representation. The empirical analysis points to several important findings. In the light of the growing concern over young people’s politics, the most important finding of this dissertation is that age bias in turnout does not have negative consequences on the policy and interest representation of age groups. In fact, young people are on average closer to their representatives than adults, and the parties they support represent their views as much as the views of other age groups. In other words, young people’s disengagement from politics does not have immediate consequences for their political representation. I argue that it is possible that the effects of youth turnout bias on policy representation are not present, partly because unequal non-electoral participation works in favor of the policy representation of the young and partly because parties try to respond to inequalities in turnout by increasing their policy appeal to the young. However, while we should not be concerned about young people’s policy representation, their interest representation is evidently unequal, and further studies are necessary to ascertain what kinds of factors create such inequalities in political outcomes.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (995k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

This justifies the inclusion of former combatants into political parties, but some argue that it can have negative consequences for democratization. Institutional engineering is proposed to forge cross-cutting parties; however, it is puzzling to find that parties from rebels often dominate in the post-conflict period. To address this puzzle I look at minority ethnic parties in post-conflict Croatia and Macedonia. SDSS dominates the competition between Serb parties in Croatia and DUI dominates between Albanian parties in Macedonia. To answer why this is so, I first look at the process of their formation and functioning and second I compared them to other minority parties. Despite the common history in Yugoslavia, the inter-ethnic conflicts, the post-conflict conditions and institutional environments for minority politics were very different in Croatia and Macedonia. My level of analysis is the competition between minority parties in each country. Because of the similar outcomes, under varying conditions, I consider that the finding in one country control for the other. Using process tracing I analyzed data from 78 interviews, party content, media and archival sources. The findings were corroborated with quantitative analysis of electoral data from national and sub-national elections in the entire post-conflict period.  I find that SDSS and DUI became most successful minority parties because they institutionalized legacies from the conflict. The parties were built on war time networks. They utilized these networks as micro social units for communication with voters and electoral mobilization. They also transferred symbolic capital from the conflict, initiated social practices to preserve it and used it as part of their electoral appeal. They channeled the post-conflict reconstruction process and gained political control over instruments for minority inclusion which gave them possibilities to extend patronage. Institutionalization of conflict's legacies in conjunction with patronage explains their electoral dominance in the post-conflict period. Other parties able to copy this model, albeit on sub-national level or to a lesser degree, were able to win or to improve their electoral support. These findings improve the understanding about post-conflict party politics, and in particular performance of parties from rebels, and contribute to literature about minority ethnic parties in competition."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2166k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Ideas such as counterforce—the targeting of enemy forces as opposed to cities—and second strike deterrence are still naturalized artefacts for academics and policymakers alike: not as much debated but refined by contemporaries. The logic of a “delicate balance of terror” outlived the superpower confrontation and has been transplanted into other issue areas, such as drone warfare, deterring terrorism or cyberattacks. Thus, the jargon of the civilian strategists commonly referred to as “defense rationalists” is still a prominent feature of contemporary US defense policy narratives, along with its inherent biases. Although claims about the laws of a non-event like nuclear war are still highly problematic, something makes these ideas “sound right”, or commonsensical. This dissertation problematizes the historical contingency of these concepts by reinterpreting the realm of nuclear strategy, construing it as an interpretative enterprise where a multitude of ideas compete. The power of ideas is most obvious in the act of naming: assigning names to phenomena, thereby enabling multiple avenues of actions. Experts in this environment in turn influence outcomes by rendering their ideas persuasive for other actors through language. This dissertation applies the toolkit of discursive institutionalism and interpretivism, and offers a conceptual synthesis of the two through a new micro-theory of persuasion: contextual suasion. Contextual suasion improves on existing approaches by linking the agency concept embedded in interpretivism, and discursive institutionalism’s concept of structure through a mechanism of idea dissemination via textualization and re(con)textualization. It understands persuasion as a correspondence between idea and its environment—a correspondence that is not necessarily static, but can be manipulated. The more an idea is in line with its context—a composite of traditions, beliefs about interests, other ideas etc.—the more it “sounds right” to audiences, and is more likely to be accepted either as an internalized belief or as a strategic tool. Institutionalization then is linked to persuasiveness through the concept of discursive dominance: in order to serve as the basis of policy decisions and institutions, an idea has to dominate the policy discourse. In order to answer the central research question—What explains the initial successful institutionalization of defense rationalism?—an empirical analysis is conducted on a selection of hallmark research from the RAND Corporation (“the quintessential Cold War think tank”) on nuclear bombing, second strike deterrence and war limitation in the early Cold War (1948-1963), showing that the lasting impact of these ideas has less to do with their problematic correspondence to reality, than their versatility as carriers of “scientific” and “rational” storylines.'}"

At its center is the recognition that democratic procedural fairness seems to come into conflict with expert scientific input into political decision-making, as expert judgment can run against the perceived fair relationship between political equals in a democracy. The tension is about the place of truth in politics, since experts are understood as people who have better access to answering new questions in their field and to ‘track the truth’ more reliably than a layperson. Privileging experts in some of our political decision-making, however, raises fears about the subversion of democratic equality because political outcomes can no longer be reliably traced back to an equitable sense of self-government of the citizenry. The work argues that this conflict can be resolved by understanding expert input as ‘expert review’, analogically to judicial review. The debate around judicial review shows that a procedure-independent standard need not subvert self-government and political equality. Similarly, many practices of expertise can be viewed as supplying some epistemic, procedure-independent standards democracies should heed. By analogy, scientific expertise does not subvert democracy – provided that the epistemic institutional advantage supplied by various expert inputs is kept in check by in-built democratic procedures maintaining the respect-worthy character of democracy. Therefore, if not their substantive contribution, what needs to be kept within reach of democratic oversight is the experts’ reliability and transparency. Consequently, the challenge ahead for democratic theory is to outline the place of experts within a system of public knowledge.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1611k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

It is by now axiomatic that citizens need to possess at least some basic political competences for them to be able to live up to the role assigned to them in democratic theory. Therefore this dissertation focuses on identifying a set of essential political competences and the factors that favor the development of such competences. Based on existing research I identify the three political competences which received the most attention in the political behavior literature: the level of political knowledge, the capacity to develop a coherent and consistent set of attitudes (i.e. attitude constraint) and the capacity to cast a vote that best represents ones interest (i.e. “attitude-congruent” voting) . I investigate both the “stable” factors that lead to inherent inequalities in political competences (e.g. socio economic status), but I also point to those factors that would lead to an increase in political competence across all groups (e.g. use of heuristics, political institutions, political elites). Furthermore, I show that at least in some cases the factors in this latter category have the potential to reduce inherent inequalities in the level of political competences that stem from differences in individual factors. After a brief introduction and overview of the existing literature I examine separately the factors that favor the development of each of these competences. In Chapter 3 I focus on the capacity of political parties to supply their supporters with cues and thus increase their level of political knowledge. I show that support for parties that have stronger incentives to fight the status quo (i.e. opposition, a smaller and/or a right-wing party) is, either directly or in an interaction with individual characteristics, related to higher levels of political knowledge. These results suggest that by relying on cues coming from such parties even the less educated and those who are not frequent media users can find alternative tools to acquire political knowledge. In Chapter 4 I confirm the role that political knowledge has for generating attitude constraint, but at the same time I show that citizens can effectively rely on constrained political elites to supply them with information that can effectively increase the level of attitude constraint. All in all Chapter 4 confirms that citizens can at least partly rely on political elites in order to acquire political competences. In Chapter 5 I concentrate on the quality of electoral decisions by developing an operationalization, i.e. “attitude-congruent” voting, that improve on existing measures. Contrary to prior research I find no empirical support to confirm a positive impact of political knowledge. Instead, Chapter 5 reveals consistent positive effects of what are generally regarded as substitutes of political knowledge in the development of more complex political competences. To be more specific Chapter 5 reveals an optimistic picture since the quality of electoral decision does not seem to be influenced by political knowledge. Instead, citizens can rely on heuristics and make use of a more simple and stable institutional structure to effectively choose the representative that best matches their interests.'}"

It critically engages with the dominant perspective on informal economic practices (new institutionalism), and elaborates an alternative, Polanyian institutionalist perspective. Relying on the Polanyian framework, I argue that social inclusion and wellbeing of marginalised, informally operating persons and groups cannot be achieved through the establishment of market-enhancing institutions (as suggested by the new-institutionalist literature), unless institutions for social protection are also established. The prevalence of informality in an aspiring capitalist society is as much related to the lack of institutionalisation of protective measures as it is related to the lack of market supporting institutions. In a context in which the institutionalisation of market economy proceeds without institutionalisation of protective measures, societal resistance and defence against marketization - commodification of land labour and money - can shift to the informal realm. In other words, it can trigger the informalization of the countermovement. While a countermovement against marketization can endanger the capitalist economy even when it proceeds within formal/legal boundaries, informally pursued countermovement runs higher risks of subverting marketization efforts and failing to ease the social consequences of marketization. In supporting these claims, the dissertation presents a case study of institutional transformation in Georgia as a most likely case to have met the new-institutionalist theoretical expectations concerning market-enhancing institutions and their impact on informal economic practices within the post-Soviet region. While Georgia was the only country that successfully adopted the new-institutionalist remedies, the reforms’ social developmental outcomes were hardly impressive in comparison with neighbouring countries. Examining the reasons for the puzzling sub-optimal outcomes of Georgia’s reforms, I identify the limits of the new-institutionalist problem analysis and remedies to the informal economy based on [1] analysis of micro, mezzo and macro level outcomes of institutional transformation in Georgia; [2] critical review of existing literature on post-soviet informality and [3] examination of the new-institutionalist theoretical premises with the help of the Polanyian institutionalist perspective. The dissertation demonstrates that Georgian reforms failed to benefit small and medium size businesses and informally self-employed traders. It also largely failed to ease the social and economic vulnerability of poor and marginalized groups. Relying on the Polanyian institutionalist perspective on informality, I suggest that the suboptimal outcomes of the post-revolutionary reforms can be ascribed to the government’s refusal to institutionalise market-constraining regulations, and protective measures, to facilitate adjustment to marketization and ease its social costs. Subsequent informalization of the resistance, or countermovement against marketization proved insufficient to ease social conflicts. The limits of informalized countermovement [1] reproduced reliance on informal economic practices, [2] undermined the capacity of the protective measures to ease social costs of marketization, and finally, [3] subverted market- enhancing reforms. The argument and the findings of this dissertation challenge not only the new-institutionalist perspective on informal economy, but also dominant development theories and policies. They challenge the pervasive academic and policy focus on quality institutions (e.g good governance, transparency, rule of law, corruption control, security of private property) by illustrating that the primary focus on market-enhancing institutions at the expense of dismissing the role of market-constraining and social regulation is not only insufficient but also counterproductive. In this light, the transnational development actors' failure to support the governments in improving institutional quality, despite their immense financial and human investments in anti-corruption and good governance promoting projects, can be understood as the result of dismissing the social costs of marketization."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3032k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

There are three prominent ways (sometimes in combination)in which this query has been approached by theorists focused on the topic of responsibility for collective wrongdoing. First, it has been addressed as a question about the subjects of moral responsibility (e.g., individuals or groups). Second, it has been treated as a question about the objects of responsibility (e.g., dateable events or character). Third, it has been regarded as a question about the conditions under which it is appropriate to hold a subject morally responsible for collective wrongdoing. This dissertation largely eschews the first two approaches. It takes as its starting point the view that individuals can be morally responsible for past events and outcomes. As is shown, these include collective wrongdoing, which is a harmful event or outcome produced by multiple agents who together concertedly act (or omit) to bring it about. This dissertation argues that only when an individual intentionally participates as a group member with others in collective wrongdoing can she be morally responsible for it as such.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (867k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

It inquires into whether the Rawlsian politico-economic system denominated property-owning democracy can rebut the Marxist challenge and answers the question in the positive. Liberal egalitarianism, especially in its Rawlsian form, has come to dominate political theory and is broadly shared among its practitioners. Since the collapse of analytical Marxism, no major challenge from the left has been posed to the liberal dominance. This thesis aims for a revival of the main ideas of analytical Marxism and draws inspiration from them to construct a critique of the latest work in the field of Rawlsian political theory. The politico-economic regime called property-owning democracy is scrutinized and eventually defended from the Marxist critique. The first two chapters of the dissertation are dedicated to an analysis of the Marxist opus. The aim of the first chapter is to defend a non-relativistic reading of the relationship between Marx and justice. The main focus of the chapter is Marx’s The German Ideology, but other quotes bearing on his view of justice are also mobilized. The chapter concludes by arguing for an account according to which morality and justice are, for Marx, both historically dependent and valid at any particular time. The second chapter defends a left-libertarian reading of Marx’s works, according to which his main tenets are interpreted as a limited form of self-ownership coupled with joint world ownership. A democratic form of socialism is presented as the institutional structure embodying the principles. The third chapter analyzes the politico-economic arrangement known as property-owning democracy. It argues that it is a system built around a fair market, populated by both hierarchical and cooperative firms. Moreover, it also maintains that Rawls’s choice for a property-owning democracy over the welfare state is based on a proper interpretation of all his principles. Finally, the chapter rejects the claim that the property-owning democracy could be understood as a system of democratic coordination, both at the level of the firm and at the level of the economy. Alternatively, a reformed market system is the preferred Rawlsian solution. The fourth and final chapter brings together these strands and compares Marx’s democratic socialism with the property-owning democracy. Five socialist objections are constructed and the Rawlsian framework is held against them. The conclusion is that most of these objections can be rebutted and that the liberal framework can offer proper replies to the socialist challenge. The thesis brings three novelties to the literature. It elaborates self-ownership centered theory Marxist theory of justice and defends it from challenges. The thesis refines the ideal of the property-owning democracy and distinguishes it from other capital distribution proposals. Thirdly, it puts these two ideals together for the first full-blown comparison of socialism and the new strands of liberalism.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

After 1989, in Poland, during such intellectual debates academics, editorialists and politicians have discussed extensively the legacy of the communist regime, and the nature of the new democratic regime, and have redefined important concepts. Particularly, discussions over the concept of patriotism or its re-definition have occurred with astonishing frequency since 25 years. Already in 1990, the renowned historian of ideas Andrzej Walicki suggested that “a new kind of Polish patriotism must be developed: a patriotism free from the archaic features of the democratic legacy of Old Poland, critical of Romantic illusions, but no less critical of [Roman] Dmowski’s version of political realism.” This statement built on the idea of civic patriotism, proposed by a dissident left-wing intellectual Jan Józef Lipski, in his significant essay “Dwie ojczyzny, dwa patriotyzmy (Two fatherlands, two patriotisms),” published in 1981. Since 1989, many other important intellectuals of various ideological allegiances have debated the desirable new formula of patriotism adapted for the times of peace and for future (Marek A. Cichocki, Dariusz Gawin, Jerzy Jedlicki, Marcin Król, Wojciech Sadurski, Władysław Stróżewski, Jerzy Szacki, Magdalena Środa, etc.). This research project analyzes a number of public debates in which the meaning of patriotism was discussed. The approach is indebted to applied political theory, and history of political thought, using the methods of conceptual history. In order to grasp the entire contestation over the meaning of political concepts and conceptual change, the analysis is threefold: textual, contextual and morphological. The use of concepts and changes in their meaning is not only due to individual authorial attempts and the influence of contextual elements, but also to the situating of concepts in specific constellations, broader chains of concepts and counter concepts. The work of interpretation, to be complete, needs to address both synchronic and diachronic perspectives of political languages/discourses and their continuous or discontinuous use in political arguments. Understanding the dynamics of these debates, the nature of the contestation over the meaning of patriotism, and why and how patriotism is made into a politically relevant concept makes it possible to explain the importance of this concept for the public sphere, political culture and thought in Poland after 1989, linking it to earlier developments. The analysis contributes to a better understanding of the re-construction of political community at the critical juncture of regime change, and of intellectual preoccupations linked to the foundations of a democratic regime. Starting from the definition of patriotism as ‘love of one’s country,’ I show how in the first decade of the democratic transition the uncertainty linked to the social, political and economic transformation pushed the discussion towards the ‘country’ aspect of the definition, the object of the allegiance. Later ‘discursive events’ offered different openings for discussing the ‘love’ aspect of the definition and the nature of allegiance. While discussions prior to 2000 attempted to find a compromise solution and middle ground in the quest for the conceptual definition, later on the debate gradually became increasingly polarized. However, despite conservative attempts at monopolization of the concept, a discursive closure has not happened, and a variety of ideological positions are still available, and continue to be put forward by emerging strong circles of conservative, left-wing or liberal intellectuals.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3733k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The literature has hitherto only speculated about the role culture plays in how leaders perform. This study argues that mindset matters and demonstrates it largely accounts for prime ministers’ integrity of conduct and effective governance that improves citizens’ welfare. The study assesses the performance of 33 Eastern European prime ministers in democratic governance based on an original data collection using expert surveys. Prime ministers’ performance in democratic governance requires delivering effective outcomes in European Union (EU) integration, economic and social policy making by concomitant respect for democratic institutions. Policy outcomes set as criteria for assessing performance requires establishing that prime ministers are the main policymaking actors. The study demonstrates that despite their formally weak Constitutional powers, most Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) prime ministers are perceived as strong in reference to their policymaking abilities. Findings of the study only partially confirm the negative culture thesis. CEE prime ministers are generally average politicians moderately respectful of democratic institutions and moderately committed to reforms that improve citizens’ welfare. They neither greatly improve nor severely erode the democratic framework or policy outcomes in EU integration, economic and social policymaking. They are largely pro-European politicians valuing EU membership and engaging in activities that bring their countries closer to the EU. That they are more democratic than effective relates to the complexity of transitions and structural reforms. Polish and Estonian prime ministers perform best in democratic governance, while Latvian prime ministers perform worst, which is in line with generally higher corruption rates in Latvia than in other countries. In reference to prime ministers’ programmatic performance, the study finds cultural variables outperform demographic and contextual variables. According to path-dependent theories, old values carry over from the past and appear important under democracy. Leaders’ mindsets, the study shows, are especially relevant in newly democratized settings where old norms and values continue to influence present developments. CEE prime ministers were socialized during communism, which was characterized by values different from norms required for democratic governance. Once transmitted into democratized settings, the old values manifested as populism, personalization of politics and corruption. Prime ministers characterized as populists and engaged in populist rhetoric are more likely to violate the democratic framework and deliver ineffective policies that erode citizens’ welfare. While the study shifts the research focus from exploring aspects of prime ministers’ position in the decision-making realm (procedural performance) to exploring the outcomes of their conduct and policymaking (programmatic performance) it also demonstrates that the relationship between different types of performance is not always symmetrical as literature suggests but very often asymmetrical. Prime ministers’ better programmatic performance did not always increase their electoral prospects. The study suggests that contextual factors surrounding elections, rather than past record in office, explains why Eastern Europeans sanction leaders who perform well and frequently keep in office leaders who performed poorly.'}"

Its main focus is on the incumbent parties in hybrid regimes that existed in Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro during the last decade of the 20th century. In addition, the thesis looks at a larger population of similar cases with the ambition to contribute to a better general understanding of the diverging party outcomes. The thesis puts forward a theoretically innovative model explaining the party outcomes, founded upon the two assumptions: (1) the diverging fates of dominant parties in hybrid regimes are determined by these partiesâ€™ (lack of) institutionalization; (2) (the lack of) their institutionalization is determined by the salience of the national question in the process of political mobilization leading to the regime establishment. Process tracing method is employed to test the presence in the three cases under observation of the thus constructed causal mechanism linking the hypothesized conditions (nationalist mobilization and the lack of party institutionalization) and party outcome (the loss of power). The theoretical relevance of the results of the analysis, supported by numerous causal process observations (including, among others, 27 in-depth interviews), is subsequently assessed within a broader empirical domain. Without eliminating the possibility of alternative explanations, albeit challenging some of the most relevant findings of the related literature, the thesis finds the empirical validity of the research model strongly corroborated by the aforementioned three cases.

Notwithstanding the persistent interest in the study of state censorship, the aspect that certain levels of coordination have to occur under invariably vague regulations is surprisingly neglected. Yet, given the role played by censorship in sustaining non-democratic regimes, the Soviet-type for instance on which the present analysis is centered, how the system internally managed to deal with uncertainties concerning censorship norms, and how the main actors coped with it, is surely a pertinent question. The research was designed to address both formal and informal aspects of the censorship process. For assessing formal organizational solutions, I use mid-level theories developed in the vein of the structural contingency approach to organizational design, whereas for the study of informal practices, I draw on theoretical insights offered by the comparative political science literature and a conceptual typology of informal practices/institutions that I developed based on three typologies (Nee and Ingram 1998, Lauth 2000, Helmke and Levitsky 2006a). In terms of methods, I combine institutional analysis and historical ethnography, which involves processing data derived from official documents and subjective sources (interviews, memoirs, diaries and contemporary correspondence). The empirical analysis is based on a single case, that is, the Romanian censorship system in the state socialist period (1949–1989). Within the case, the focus on formal mechanisms is narrowed to the extreme end of the pre-publication procedure, the activity of local censors’ offices namely. With regards to informal mechanisms, the analysis is focalized on positive interpersonal relationships between the actors of the censorship system, particularly those nurtured among the controllers and controlled, and the allied informal practices. The intensive analysis of the Romanian case resulted that the effective implementation of the censorship policy was maintained by a complex set of formal organizational coordination and control mechanisms that were appropriately designed to meet critical contingencies (i.e. task uncertainty), as well as by various types of informal practices based on trust-centered interpersonal ties. The types of informal practices that furthered the formal scopes of censorship include the spread and clarification of information regarding censorship norms via peers and censors (complementary informal practices), censors sharing confidential directives (accommodating practices), as well as counseling and ensuring with controllers prior to official checking (substitutive practices). The fourth type comprises interactions that eventually undermined the effectiveness of the censorship policy, practices such as negotiations between the censors and editors-in-chief/authors, intervening through personalized networks on behalf of a publication, or taking a risk by turning a blind eye to problematic issues (competing of practices). These findings complement accounts of the functioning and effectiveness of the Soviet-type censorship system primarily focused on macro institutional and organizational configurations. Furthermore, the results shed light on practices constituting the domain of “self-censorship”, which is also claimed by the literature to represent an important factor contributing to the effectiveness of censorship. Finally, by focusing on positive interpersonal ties and related practices, the findings considerably alter the dominant narrative centered on negative relationships between the controllers and the controlled, yet they also show that many interactions based on positive ties had the same effects as their negative counterparts: raising the performance of the censorship system.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2650k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Arguing against claims that neutrality and perfectionism exclude each other, the dissertation posits that liberal neutrality and perfectionism are convergent, not divergent, philosophical ideals. The dissertation is divided into five distinct chapters. The introduction provides a general philosophical framework of the problem and contextualizes its significance against the extant literature. Chapter 1 argues that the ideal of liberal neutrality depends on the conception of the good defined by the value of autonomy. It surveys different philosophical arguments about neutrality, including theories of political liberalism based on epistemic, pluralist and reasonability reasons for neutrality and argues that none of these is sufficient to establish the principle of neutrality. Chapter 2 defends a particular understanding of autonomy. It argues that a horizontal, rather than hierarchical, theory better resolves some of the standard philosophical problems with autonomy. The chapter expands the theory by arguing that autonomy is best understood in terms of the open future principle that reconciles contingency and spontaneity with individual ability to act authentically. Chapter 3 builds on these claims to argue that the normative value of autonomy cannot be fully appraised within anti-perfectionist theories of liberalism because their basic assumptions do not correspond to the horizontal theory. This theory presumes the fundamentally relational nature of autonomy that depends on a range of first-order facts and structures that make individuals capable of autonomous behavior. Against this background, the chapter suggests that liberal perfectionism needs to recalibrate its concern and focus on developing autonomy-building interpersonal relations. Chapter 4 argues that ideals of neutrality and perfectionism in liberalism converge by way of conceptual and practical reasons. Conceptual reasons imply that institutional requirements of neutrality and perfection serve to provide supporting justifications to each other. Institutional neutrality is owed only toward individuals who have autonomously chosen and sustained their conceptions of the good. Institutional promotion of autonomy aims to ensure that neutrality requirements are satisfied. Practical reasons imply that normative requirements of open future demand convergence of neutralist and perfectionist claims. The chapter surveys different elements of social context that have normative significance for the convergence thesis. Chapter 5 demonstrates that the thesis of convergence between liberal neutrality and perfection can be applied to concrete cases of social policy that involve conflicting demands based on differing conceptions of the good.

The research focuses on forms and mechanisms of cooperation between Russian state institutions and Russian companies abroad. As the central republic of world’s former military superpower and its direct successor in international organizations, one of the world’s largest oil and gas exporters, and territorially the world’s largest country, Russia has usually been perceived as an imperial expansionist. The assertive foreign policy rhetoric of its political leadership has contributed to these perceptions. As a result, outward foreign direct investments of Russian companies, especially those of energy-exporting companies, have been perceived as agents channeling Russian national interests abroad. They have also been portrayed as such by most of the literature on Russian foreign policy and by the largely fragmented literature on Russian outward foreign direct investments. However, empirical observation has shown that there have been a significant number of mismatches between rhetoric about the activities of Russian companies abroad and their actual action. Therefore, the dissertation addresses two general and one specific question: What is the relation between Russian foreign policy and foreign direct investments? To what extent, if at all, is Russian foreign policy important in Russian outward foreign direct investments? Under what conditions and in which forms do Russian state institutions and Russian companies abroad cooperate with each other? While a few scholars have recognized business interests as motives that drive Russian outward investments, other non-political motives for Russian FDI have largely been neglected in the literature. The dissertation relies on an extensive dataset consisting of official documents and iimore than seventy interviews. The core is forty interviews with representatives of Russian state institutions (ministries, embassies, and trade and commercial representative offices abroad) and representatives of Russian transnational corporations and small-and-medium enterprises in Germany, Hungary, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Qualitative content analysis is used in the analysis of the data. Results demonstrate that although business interests serve as the most frequent drivers of Russian outward foreign direct investments and are quite frequently mixed with individual profit-seeking interests of Russian private companies’ owners and managers of state-owned companies, the latter usually portray them as Russian national interests. Therefore, in contrast to the widely shared view in the literature on Russian foreign policy, state institutions abroad usually serve the business interests of Russian companies, and not vice versa. Most importantly, the results show that cooperation between Russian state institutions and Russian companies abroad depends on a combination of economic factors – four characteristics of the host market (size, sophistication, regulations of foreign direct investments, and competition by other foreign investors) and social factors (reactions to Russian investments in host country). The more complex the host market (including reactions to Russian foreign direct investments), the more Russian companies aim to intensify cooperation with Russian state institutions in a host country in instances of foreign direct investments.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1598k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

I argue that these solutions are distinct from those familiar from the previous generations of late developing countries, so much so that they constitute a new variety of late development, which I call hyperintegrationist. Hyper-integrationist development model is distinguished primarily by the centrality of the role of foreign capital, and the way it is incorporated in the response to development challenges. Contrary to the mainstream theories of FDI and development, which see FDI as a vehicle of transfer of technology and skills from foreign to local actors, I show that in the hyperintegrationist development model FDI does not advance the growth of the host country by helping to develop domestic capabilities, but by substituting them with external resources. This form of development also requires different arrangement to govern the relations between key actors: multinationals on the one hand, and local states, capital and labour on the other. The role of the state in particular changes from that of the facilitating transfers of technology and skills to local firms to attracting and directing the flows of foreign capital towards the most promising activities. States in the hyper-integrationist developers are more constrained by the international regulatory environment than their peers in other late development varieties, and in order to achieve their goals they are forced to draw on a more fragmented set of alliances, many of them transnational in nature. Although their commitment to international integration limits the range of tools they can use to impose performance targets on foreign companies, it can also occasionally provide them with some mechanisms to resist the more onerous demands on their part. Hyper-integrationist approach to development also carries a specific constellation of advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, substitution of capabilities through transnational investment networks can lead to faster modernisation and increased export potential. Using the example of automotive industry, I show how the East Central European countries managed to achieve in record time the level of international competitiveness that is comparable to some of the most successful examples of late development in other regions of the world. On the other hand, the effects the local production factors have not been equally positive. For all its success in advancing external competitiveness, hyper-integrationist development model does not seem to have an internal mechanism for upgrading of skills or technology. Domestic firms have been all but eliminated from the competition, the demand for technology production remains low, and the region continues to rely on its low-cost advantage, with limited investments in workforce skills. This mismatch between catch up and convergence may not necessarily have a negative impact on the region’s performance in the medium term, so long as they continue to attract sufficient foreign investment. At the same time, however, it has already created some tensions within the model, especially between foreign investors and labour.

Previous comparative research emphasized the role of institutions in conditioning individuals’ behavior and attitudes. I argue that not only the institutional design, but also the quality of the political institutions in the country constrains citizens’ political attitudes, preferences, and decisions. I do this by examining how living in countries with different quality of governance affects people’s institutional trust,perceptions of representation and accountability, attitudes towards the welfare state, voting behavior, and election results both in an absolute sense and relative to the design of the political institutions. Doing so this dissertation builds on and contributes to the literature of comparative political behavior, contextual effects, and political institutions, and has substantive and normative implications for the study of electoral democracy. All of the empirical analyses are cross-national and employ multilevel analyses of data from Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the World Value Survey, and different indicators of the quality of governance and political institutions.  After a brief introduction, I examine the implications of various aspects of good governance on individuals’ confidence in different public and political institutions. I find that some aspects of good governance have a stronger impact on institutional trust than others, but how the institutions provide judicial and bureaucratic efficiency and control of corruption clearly makes them look more or less trustworthy. I then look at the role of the quality of governance in shaping individual preferences toward income redistribution and social welfare policies, and find that bad governance leads to a remarkable inconsistency in individuals’ preferences, preferring more extensive social benefits simultaneously with less income redistribution. I investigate further whether people feel less represented and politicians’ less accountable under bad governance in chapter four. I find that institutional design matters more for a sense of procedural representation, while good governance is more important for substantive representation. Chapter five focuses on the link between the impact of ideology, economic evaluations and partisanship on the vote on the one hand, and corruption on the other, and the implications of cultural norms for these relationships. I find that as corruption rises, ideological considerations and sympathies towards the chief executive party weigh less in voters’ decision; and while living in a country with a strong culture of corruption does not make people adopt different voting behavior, it instills a higher likelihood of voting against the incumbent. Before concluding, I test the electoral implications of good governance for incumbent’s survival in chapter six, and find that the quality of governance is as important as the economy.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2002k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

By answering these questions, this dissertation contributes to the broader research field on temporal and spatial variation of domestic responses to comparable international conditions. In order to understand the factors of prioritizing security in energy policy, and their facilitating and inhibiting conditions, in countries in transition, through case selection, I isolate effects of fundamentals and external factors. As I observe in the Central and East European countries in transition, policies enhancing energy security are prioritized when three aspects coincide and interact: When popular perception of threat, which can plausibly be connected to the energy supply, is high and concentrated among supporters of ruling parties; when former elites who can draw on personal links with the perceived source of threat, and thus can dampen the effects of threat are removed from power; and when incumbent industrial interests are de-concentrated and face obstacles in promoting their interests. I also argue that change of ownership lowering the control of government over energy assets, privatization, was an obstacle to prioritizing policies aiming to increasing energy security. The broader theoretical contribution of this dissertation consists of argument for reframing the energy policy debate by bringing back domestic politics, and by contributing to understanding of security policy prioritization during transition. Energy security, albeit important, is only one of the aspects that are being pursued by governments. Through this project I also lay the foundations for broader conceptual model for analyzing energy security, within context, as one of the energy policy priorities.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

The project develops a critical juncture - path-dependency argument as a theoretical framework for understanding the various trajectories of these three peak level unions. I demonstrate that unions’ own critical choices and strategies of organizational self-empowerment during the system change period have mattered in shaping organizational trajectories. I argue that unions were able to become politically relevant if and only if they had overcome specific ‘inherited’ organizational vulnerabilities, achieved autonomy, and adapted to and increased their own capacities in the new environment, and exercised an autonomous voice in influencing politics and policy-making. Perceived in this way, I demonstrate that organizational reform and political self-positioning during system change had a lasting effect, leaving a sticky imprint on union trajectories. Slovenia’s ZSSS demonstrates a successful case, where the union built on its organizational resources and increased mobilization capacities, and took advantage of a wide space for strategic maneuvering for taking part in ideological struggles and policy making. In contrast, in an authoritarian populist elite-dominated Serbia, the trade union leadership of the SSS even gave up its struggle for autonomy from the elite. It disregarded the potential for mobilization of the rank and file members in favor of the security, protection, and preserved representational monopoly from the state. Finally, unlike the SSS the Polish OPZZ had sufficient autonomy to select its path, but it had less organizational capacities and faced greater political challenges than the ZSSS. The OPZZ overcame political isolation by entering into a political coalition, a strategy which, in the long run, execrated internal organizational vulnerabilities.  By comparing the three cases I offer a corrective to understandings of trade unionism in Eastern Europe. I highlight the importance of resource mobilization and organizational self-empowerment at critical moments, dangers and advantages of alliances with political parties, and, especially, the under-explored factor of organizational resources as conditions for the ‘success’ of peak level unions. I find that the variation in union trajectories is explained by the historically rooted functions and character of the state (Birnbaum 1982) rather than the short-term choices and policies of the elite during system change as it is commonly understood in the literature.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1200k)'}"

I start my examination with the assumption that participation in informal political conversations promotes individuals’ political participation and contributes to an increase in their level of political cognition. I analyze the effects of everyday political discussion in two types of micro social settings – close, intimate and generic ones. Results indicate that political discussion in either type of social setting has both direct and indirect effects on voting and political knowledge. Most of the direct effects are moderated by macro contextual factors. Specifically, frequency of political talk in intimate settings appears to advance individual political knowledge in those countries characterized by extensive political talk in the micro social settings. Political agreement with close, intimate peers stimulates electoral participation, especially in newly democratized countries. Frequent political talk within generic social settings, on the other hand, generates an increase in political knowledge in less developed countries. With regard to the indirect effects, my results indicate that political discussion stimulates individuals’ attention to political news in media and general political interest. Political interest and media attentiveness are, in turn, the most significant antecedents of voting and political knowledge. I continue with an empirical examination of the hypothesis that political discussion is a significant antecedent of individual political engagement and test different directions of influences between the two. Results indicate that the assumption present in the previous literature might not be tenable in its original form. In the context of Japan, the classical direction of effects seems to be reversed; more politically knowledgeable and opinionated people are more likely to engage in political conversations. On the other hand, there is evidence that informal political talk influences individuals’ levels of political opinionation and knowledge indirectly. More frequent political discussion and membership in loosely connected networks of political conversation strongly affects individuals’ interest in politics, which, in turn, influences their level of political knowledge. For the relationship between political discussion and participation, my results confirm the expectations formulated by the previous literature; frequent political conversation stimulates participation in political and civic activities in Hungary. Having established that in some contexts and under specific circumstances micro social settings play an important role in politics, I examine the supply side of those politically relevant features of social networks, in countries dissimilar in their democratic experiences. The results indicate that people from countries with a more recent democratic experience are, in general, part of smaller, less diverse, less politicized and more politically homogeneous social networks compared to their counterparts from older democracies. Within the group of newly democratized countries, people who were socialized in a democratic period are similar to young generations from consolidated democracies in their patterns of social connectivity. However, in the new democracies, those generations who were socialized in democracy tend to participate less in political conversations compared to those who became adults under authoritarian regimes.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3195k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The regimes with concentrated power are believed to be particularly dangerous for the states with deep ethnic cleavages. This latter concern is a question of great importance for the post-Soviet region, because since the collapse of the Soviet Union some of the multi-ethnic post-Soviet states had the experience of both ethnic conflicts and concentration of power. Consequently, the main goal of this research is to determine whether power concentration encourages the escalation of ethnic conflicts. For this, I explore three mechanisms that may link the degree of power concentration with ethnic minorities’ mobilization against the state: identity-related state policies, electoral rules, and centralization. The empirical investigation is built on the analysis of three post-Soviet cases – Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine – based on the structured focused comparison technique. The data presented in this research reveal that the highest level of ethnic minorities’ mobilization against the state in the three post-Soviet republics occurred in periods with dispersed power, and not in periods with concentrated power. The research further shows that contrary to the common expectation, the reason for this was not the presumed suppressive character of concentrationist regimes over ethnic groups as citizens. Instead, the incumbent elites in the periods with power concentration combined minorities’ cooptation in central and local power with the enhanced control over the regional elite formation and regional access to financial resources, and in some cases, with a gradual de-politization of societal multi-ethnicity. Specifically, the leadership of concentrationist regimes tended to increase the threshold for accessing power through electoral rules with disproportional elements, which prevented the consolidation of ethnic parties and at the same time attracted minority leaders to the ruling parties. In addition, concentration of power tended to augment territorial centralization. This implied an increased control by central level political incumbents over the financial, administrative, and political affairs at regional level, which reduced local potential mobilizers’ access to mobilization resources. Finally, as the leadership of power concentration tended to implement integrationist rather than accommodationist policies towards minorities, this de-emphasized the political importance of multi-ethnicity.  The research concludes that at least in the three cases included in the analysis, concentration of power did not trigger, but it rather discouraged ethnic mobilization against the state, due to its intrinsic tendencies to increase the threshold for access to power of potential challengers and also to co-opt minority leaders, to strengthen centralization of power, and to de-politicize ethnicity. Hence, the success of concentrationist regimes in reducing minorities’ mobilization against the state did not consist in suppressing ethnic groups as citizens, but in hindering the formation of a self-standing ethnic minority elite. Therefore, if power concentration is to be avoided in the post-Soviet region, it should be for other reasons than for fear of ethnic instability.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (5258k)'}"

It focuses on the d65, which is a critical case for East-West labor transnationalism in view of the importance of cost comparisons among car plants in different countries. The analysis of Polish-German union relations at three car and car component manufacturing companies, Volkswagen’s engine plants, GM and MAN, shows that the German unions sought to establish cooperative links with their Polish counterparts in the areas subject to cross-border comparisons, when no national negotiation channels were available to them and thus the danger of underbidding by the cheaper Polish plants was particularly high. The Poles, in turn, cooperated in exchange for the Germans’ support, only if they expected to benefit more from the Western assistance than from local solutions. Alternatively, they did not hesitate to utilize their comparative advantage of lower wages and inferior working conditions to attract new production. The resulting cooperation was based on reciprocal exchange. The Germans helped the Poles build up their organizations and assisted them during disputes with the local management, whereas the Poles committed themselves not to underbid the Germans during investment distribution rounds. Overall, East-West European labor transnationalism was guided primarily by cost-benefit considerations. The evidence on GM unions’ reactions to the economic crisis of 2008-2009 corroborates this assertion, showing that German employee representatives used enhanced government access to secure the interests of their sites at the cost of other locations, which led to deep divisions in the once unified cross-border GM labor front.  The last chapter tests the above arguments against evidence from the construction sector, in which the inflow of CEE workers to West European labor markets constituted a major source of competitive pressure. It shows that the mechanism governing interactions between Polish and German construction unions resembled the one identified in the car industry. Specifically, the scope of cooperation remained narrower due to the German union’s attachment to national solutions and limited gains derived by the two Polish organizations from participating in migrant workers’ assistance schemes.'}"

I hold that the transition from collective crime to the rule of law ought to be conceptualized as a context in which the ‘perverted group ethics’, which attempts to justify avoidance to deal with the criminal past, ought to be morally evaluated and disqualified. This is the time when the re-establishment of the moral community becomes the necessary condition of the very possibility of the establishment of democracy. A normative change from denial to acceptance of responsibility is required because victims ask us to acknowledge and to remember.  Although I borrow from both, the individualist and the collectivist accounts of moral responsibility, I ultimately reject both in favor of a shared moral responsibility account, which requires that besides the membership criteria, the participation criteria be fulfilled as well. Thus, I hypothesize, that agents who share their collective identity with the perpetrators and who fail to uphold already accepted universal moral norms can be conceptualized as bystanders, a morally faulty group that produces harm against the community of victims, both, during the life of the criminal project (T1), and in the transitional period (T2).', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1748k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The first chapter reviews the most recent literature on educational institutions and their link to the inequality of opportunity. The most unambiguous finding of the literature is that selective educational institutions associate strongly with inequality. In the second chapter I use the PISA 2003 data to test the association of educational institutions with the inequality of opportunity and the effectiveness. Despite the small number of countries (29 OECD countries), the results are policy relevant. Of them the most important is that earlier age of selection into different school-types and the number of school-types are significantly associated with higher inequality of opportunity. The third chapter looks at the case of Hungary where early selection replaced the more comprehensive school system, a rare development in international perspective. The early selective tracks cream-skim the best students at age 10 and at age 12 instead of the official age 14. Using a unique panel dataset I show that early selective tracks are more beneficial for higher status families. These tracks have a higher value-added in reading and mathematical literacy and in continuing studies in tertiary education. Their student composition is of higher status and higher skilled students. Thus they lead to an increase in the inequality of opportunities. Weaker tests show that while students’ of early selective tracks gain, those left in general tracks loose. The last chapter looks at the evolution of the current Hungarian system, including the early selective tracks, and it tries to answer the question: why and how such a system could evolve. I argue that three factors were important: (1) historical conditions (2) decentralization and (3) democracy. The two historical conditions are the memory of the elite 8-year-long academic schools, the gimnáziums, and the decentralized administrative structure of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. As a result of democratization and decentralization after the post-communist transition, higher status people could shape local policies easier than before, which led to the proliferation of the early selective tracks and to the increasing selectivity of the education system. In addition, the two main political powers emerging at the post-communist transition, the conservatives and the liberals, have both supported the establishment of early selective tracks on different ideological grounds, and this quasi compromise was implicitly approved by the socialists.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2393k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The task of this research was thus to assess the relative role of informal social structures in projects aimed at establishing and consolidating indigenous political units in the North Caucasus and to identify the principal internal reasons for the outcomes of these projects. On the basis of long-term participant observation, interviews with experts, analysis of historical data and modern political processes this thesis argues that clans (teips) have seized to be patterns of political integration of any prominence in Ingushetia and Chechnya. As a result of demographic growth and social change brought about by colonization, Soviet modernization and frequent forced and voluntary resettlements, they lost their organizational structure and are incapable to mobilize members for action. Five case studies show that although certain traditional institutions and practices still play an important role in the society, state-building is determined by struggle for power between socially heterogeneous groups that are driven by ideologies, programs, economic or military interests, and can be based on strong or weak ties. Five structural factors influence elite formation and state-building in the region: descent, kinship, territory, religion and ideology. The prominence of each of them is dependent on elite choices and the particular demands of the state-building project. Governments differ in how homogeneous they are, and how strong are the ties binding their members together. I conclude that the lack of checks and balances and a risk-prone environment increase the relevance of strong ties.

This thesis investigates this research question both theoretically and empirically. It draws on Gary Miller’s (2000) theory of interactive social production, which advocates the welfare-enhancing properties of a de-politicized bureaucracy (or civil service), and develops it further by showing the capacity of individual elements of civil service to contain politicians’ moral hazard. This theoretical argument is then investigated within the empirical milieu of regional governance of post-Soviet Russia. Statistical analysis shows that, controlling for relevant factors, the striking variation in the levels of aggregate economic performance and small business growth observed across Russia’s regions is accounted for by the extent to which bureaucracy is de-politicized. Two cases-studies from the context of post-Soviet Russia further illuminate the working of the causal mechanism. These quantitative and qualitative analyses constitute the first empirical verification of Miller’s theoretical explanation of the welfare-enhancing properties of de-politicized bureaucracies.  The documented variation in de-facto de-politicization of bureaucracy in Russia’s regions allows an inquiry into the reasons for the adoption of real merit, which is a persistent puzzle in social science. Whilst dominant explanations underscore the importance of interactions among core constituencies of voters, legislators, and executives in democratic settings, they fail to explain the adoption of merit in autocracies and are not corroborated empirically outside the Anglo-Saxon world. Utilizing analytical tools from game theory, this thesis offers an alternative – formal and parsimonious – theoretical explanation as to the conditions under which self-interested politicians opt to curb their authority over bureaucratic personnel decisions. Central to this explanation is the idea of the ruler’s discount rate or time horizons, which reflects the ruler’s strategic thinking over time as affected by the likely reaction of economic agents to the ruler’s choices. The thesis also subjects this theory to empirical test, using the obtained measure of de-politicization of bureaucracy as dependent variable. Controlling for factors from existing theories, it is found that rulers’ discount rate is the most powerful predictor of the level of de-politicization of bureaucracy. By challenging conventional wisdom about the factors that lead to the adoption of civil service, this thesis represents both theoretical and empirical contributions to the literature on merit adoption.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (2926k)'}"

It advances a theoretical framework that combines IR and CP approaches based on two major variables: the type of EU involvement (direct versus indirect) and the degree of freedom of domestic political elites in transforming according to EU standards and requirements. The intervening variables from the European level are considered the degree of clarity of EU stipulations and EU material incentives. The number of internal veto players, party strategic behavior, and party-government relation are argued to be the major domestic intervening factors. The empirical findings show that European Union can exercise both direct and indirect influence outside its borders. Brussels can be directly involved in EEN party politics via two mechanisms: the adjustment of party-related laws to European stipulations (as stated in APs) and the compliance to EPFs’ affiliation requirements. Yet, the evidence shows that at the moment this type of influence is limited because of the vaguely defined EU requirements within the APs and reduced material incentives, particularly the absence of EU membership perspective, and the strength of liberal-democratic opposition forces. The thesis confirms that indirect European level influence is stronger in the case of EEN outsiders. Two mechanisms of indirect influence are examined hereby: the change in patterns of party interaction and coalition formation and the emergence of pro- and anti-European parties. While the empirical results show the lack of successful parties that establish their identity in their Europeaness, they also point to the existence of EU involvement in the change of party interaction by means of supporting the coalition of pro-European forces (e.g. ‘electoral revolutions’ in Georgian and Ukraine). However, EU leverage decreases considerably once the decisive points of political crisis are overcome and party strategic calculations are responsible for the final outcome of EU influence, constrained by partygovernment position and the strength of opposition forces. Finally, EU fails to contribute to the consolidation of EEN party organizations and party systems, which remain weakly institutionalized and characterized by a fluid political environment as well as instability and unpredictability in the patterns of party interaction. Overall, the dissertation represents an important academic contribution by providing original empirical data based on MRG manifesto content-analysis, expert surveys, and party leader interviews. Although the work is limited to the case of East European neighborhood, the advanced theoretical framework can be applied to the study of other EU outsiders, particularly within the post-Soviet space.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (910k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The principal argument of this dissertation is that social and economic changes in advanced industrial societies linked to deindustrialization produced a social structure that is by and large more complex than that of classic industrial societies before or just after the Second World War. The complexity of post-industrial societies can be described as ‘greater fragmentation’, which is caused by the crosscutting of a large number of social characteristics that define one’s position in post-industrial societies. In short, fragmentation essentially means that both middle and working classes in post-industrial societies do not represent a unified actor to the same extent that they did in classic industrial societies. In the middle-class there is a new sizable group of professionals, and in the working-class there is a division between exposure to market risk and sector of employment. Such fragmented social structure made it difficult for established parties of the left and right to cover the whole newly emerged political space, so the emergence of new parties of the new left and the new right was inevitable. What exact shape these new competitors took in each country depended upon the type of welfare regime, models of capitalism and the policies that governments implemented in response to the process of deindustrialization.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1630k)'}"

Firstly, I argue that there is no significant discrepancy between the levels of behavioral unity in Central Eastern Europe and Western Europe. There is however a significant difference in the unity of attitudes between Eastern and Western Europe, and the same difference in terms of unity of attitudes is also significant when old and new democracies are compared. Secondly, the results show the supremacy of party characteristics in explaining unity of behavior. Ideological congruence is a good predictor of how united a party is going to be in parliament. High centralization and disciplinary rules contribute as well to achieving a high level of behavioral unity. Thirdly, the more importance MPs allocate to representing their constituents, the lower will be their unity of behavior in the parliament. Fourthly, contrary to expectations and against many propositions advanced earlier in the party literature, systemic factors, like federalism, parliamentarism, and electoral system perform poorly in explaining MPsâ€™ voting unity in the legislature.  Theoretically, the thesis explains party unity from state and party perspectives and advances a model which works for European political parties. First of all, I suggest that definitions of political parties which regard them as unitary actors could be revised to consider the distinction between attitudes and behavior. My PhD thesis builds on the differences between unity of behavior and unity of attitudes, a conceptualization which better addresses the complexities inherent in the issue of party unity because unity on one of these dimensions does not always guarantee the same level of unity on the other. Secondly, my thesis shows that even if institutional conditions would not favor unitary party behavior in parliament, parties adapt and use their own tools in order to become a unitary voting bloc. Consequently, whether party government is in danger or not, because of declining partisanship within the electorate or because of the convergence of parties into a mainstream consensus, party unity will always enhance it and maintain it. Thirdly, the findings of this thesis allow me to conclude that some paradoxes of representative democracy still persist. If one assumes that external democracy is achieved, then there are instances in which this happens at the expense of internal party democracy. Some parties apply high levels of central control and disciplinary rules in order to be unitary in the parliament and to vote for the policies proposed. Fourthly, the process of party formation and development are also related to unity of attitudes and unity of behavior. While unity of attitudes develops rather slowly, the latter can change more rapidly when intra-party mechanisms of coercion are applied.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1366k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Contemporary republican theories propose to do just that, and thus to incorporate elements of radical democracy in a liberal-democratic political framework, without exacting too high costs on individual freedom, sliding into oppressiveness or coming too close to liberal arguments. This dissertation enables us to explore the basic republican idea that individual freedom is dependent on citizens’ civic engagement in public life. By assessing contemporary republican themes and arguments of different varieties, I hope to determine republicanism’s normative salience and claim to distinctiveness. That is a simplification, for there is no single republican argument but a multitude of different strategies in arguing for some form of enhanced engagement in public life, from contestation of political decisions that do not track individuals’ interests to participation in diffuse deliberative fora of civil society. My aim is not to develop or reconstruct an institutional theory of republicanism, but to discern the normative arguments behind a republican political morality. It becomes apparent from my analysis that it is not to the notion of freedom as non-domination or the common good expressed in the form of national identity that we should look for normative support of a republican argument. Instead, the notion of participation in public deliberations on matters of shared concern, as the way to preserve the ‘justificatory’ character of a reasonably just democratic community emerges as the most salient form of republican ‘civic virtue’. I further argue that the most promising way to promote a republican theory along these lines is to construct an argument for republican political obligation that entails the obligations to deliberate, to do so from public reason, and to endorse a redistributive notion of equality. If republicanism is to be taken seriously, it needs to present a normative argument for the specific obligations that it promotes. Finally, I argue that a notion of political obligation understood in this thick, republican way could be justified as a form of role obligation constructed around the role of citizen in a reasonably just democratic society. By constructing a notion of political obligation from a republican perspective, we hope to contribute an overall normative justification to contemporary republican arguments.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1233k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

But are all democracies equally peaceful? This dissertation contends that parliamentary and presidential systems do differ in their international risk-taking propensity and offers a new institutionalist explanation for why it is so and that the relationship between regime type and accountability is curvilinear. The dissertation contributes to three bodies of literature: first, it refines the definition of democratic regime types by separating the permanent (constitutional) and the temporary (political) dimensions. Second, working out the relationship between the democratic peace theory and the literature on the diversionary use of force, it contneds that the relationship between accountability is curvilinear. That is, some constraints (accountability to the electorate) make states behave in a risk-averse manner, while other constraints (accountability to the political elite i.e. the parliament and the cabinet) propel international risk-taking. Prospect theory is used to clarify the conditions under which the curvilinear relationship between accountability and risk-taking appears. The time frame of the six qualitative case studies (Korea 1950-1953, Dominican Republic 1965, and Grenada 1983, Malaya 1948-1957, Kenya 1952-1956, and Suez 1956) are the Cold War and . The approach taken is qualitative. The empirical analysis is limited to the period of the cold war and examines only the necessary conditions of risk-taking. It controls for the influence of personality, party ideology, and conflict intensity and includes wars under both domestically safe and adversarial conditions. Case studies provide support for the hypotheses, but minor modifications appear to be in order. Conflict intensity appears to be an important intervening variable. The present conceptualization of accountability can be expanded to explain the difference in risk-taking among autocratic and democratic regimes, and, thus, resolve the dilemma of the existence of some constraints on non-democratic leaders. The findings also suggest that the lack of unequivocal findings in the diversionary literatures may be, at least in part, due to the literature’s strong focus on the United States. In other words, diversion has been examined most in a context where it is least likely to occur.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1153k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Chapters one and two review the empirical and formal literatures on privatization and argue that informational asymmetries with respect to the value of the enterprise prepared for sale, workers’ opposition, and rent seeking are important obstacles to privatization plans.  Chapter three presents two simple formalizations of the idea that a government determined to privatize an enterprise may need to privatize only a part of that enterprise because of asymmetric information. Partial privatization signals the enterprise’s worth to investors and is therefore a second best strategy available to a government, which seeks to maximize revenues from privatization and enhance enterprise efficiency. Hence partial privatization need not improve enterprise performance, rather better performing enterprises tend to be partially privatized. On the other hand, privatization raises concerns about future job cuts and therefore workers often oppose privatization plans. Because of this resistance, governments tend to scale down, if not entirely abandon, initially quite ambitious privatization programs. Whenever privatization plans are not fully abandoned, governments could implement partial privatization, selling either a fraction of the enterprise or separate units belonging to it, in a bid to secure the workers’ acquiescence. How can partial privatization work as a mechanism that commits the government to cater to workers’ interests ex post? Assuming that the average worker cares about employment more than about efficiency and profits, chapter four suggests the following mechanism: under certain conditions, partial privatization softens the budget constraint that the prospective enterprise owner would face, which will lead to the implementation of a larger number of investment projects, regardless of their efficiency, than otherwise and thereby increase employment above the optimal level. Such a commitment device on the part of the selling government is credible because it relies on the government’s purely economic incentives, rather than just on its benevolence, paternalism or political ideology. Chapter four also speculates that the continuous nature of the government’s involvement, namely the incremental provision of the soft budget, resolves the flipside of the commitment problem, i.e. ensures that workers would cast their votes for the government in question. Finally, chapter five argues that governments may refuse to privatize enterprises that would be valuable to their future owners primarily in terms of the subsidies that can be extracted from the state. Changes in the market environment effected by privatization imply changes in the role and nature of rent (or subsidy) seeking activities. Chapter five makes use of some of the results in the literature on rent seeking contests to identify factors that affect the amount of resources devoted to such socially wasteful activities.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (960k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Existing scholarship on the topic, focusing mostly on the regional intergovernmental arrangements established in the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars, seems to agree that the European Union had the decisive role in the process, even if not through direct intervention. Instead, I argue that democratic rather than EU conditionality was mostly at play in this case. At the same time, post Cold War regionalism has been also a race to appropriate better mental spaces in the attempt to be recognised as part of the democratic community. In order to investigate this hypothesis of democratic conditionality and rhetoric action, I analyze comparatively the creation and evolution of the major Central and East European regional intergovernmental initiatives. For this purpose, I use the conceptual frameworks of social constructivism and international regionalism, which I further develop particularly through the introduction of the concept of regional cohesiveness. Prompted by the necessity to find an alternative to the regional integration/interdependence paradigm, this concept refers to the degree to which a group of actors inhabiting a limited contiguous space act and represent themselves as a group. In terms of methods, I use discourse analysis tools loosely inspired by the archaeological method of Michel Foucault. Mainly due to the conceptual setting, the dissertation is a prospective one, aiming at identifying the potential of the regional cohesiveness concept using the particular case of post Cold War Central and East European regionalism. At the same time, it aims at producing a theoretically framed monograph of the most important Central and East European regional intergovernmental arrangements, underpinned by a historical account of their constitutive conditions.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2403k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Infrastructure investment finances at all levels of government  are especially prone to election cycles and corruption. Driven from the above context the basic research question guiding my work is: whether local infrastructure policies in Hungary are really designed according to efficiency considerations? What politico-economic factors might affect central and local governmentsâ€™ allocations on infrastructure investment? To complete this goal, a closer look at municipal capital investment financing in Hungary takes place. Related to the main research question several themes emerge and hypotheses are checked on the effects of the revenue base, local need and socioeconomic indicators on local investment strategies and financing constructions or grant allocations. Does grant financing mean a less careful financial planning? What is the importance of lobbying through different channels?  I also search for - and in fact do find  evidence of electoral cycle effects and partisan considerations (effect of similarities in political color of central and local governments) in intergovernmental grant distribution and in municipal investment activities. These issues to be researched call for a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Some of my hypothesis are tested on limited data from a 2004 survey of city mayors in Hungary. Hypotheses on cycles, determinants of investment outlays of local governments and grant recipiency are tested with linear and Probit panel regressions respectively on a panel dataset comprehensive for all Hungarian local government budgets from 1993-2003, a period bridging three election cycles, linked with some demographic,socioeconomic data and local election data.  Findings can add to the discussion on reforming local government finance system overall, on the agenda in Hungary for quite a while, but perhaps also to the new literature on the political economy of failures, delays in socially beneficial reforms. What this dissertation certainly does contribute to is the fairly small pool of international empirical evidences available on political budget cycles, especially at the sub-national level and the emerging literature on the political economy of intergovernmental grants  providing the case of one transition country that irrespective of the fact of by now being an EU member sometimes shows certain similarities to the developing ones.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1409k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

These new studies, however, tend to focus exclusively on the Al Qaeda-type Islamic terrorism and forget that there are numerous historical cases of terrorism that are enlightening when we try to understand the phenomenon. In addition, the studies both before and after the September 11 attacks tend to leave aside one important element of terrorism, i.e. its political nature, or, more precisely, the impact it has on the politics of the country (or region, or the entire world).  The objective of this thesis is to assess how the presence of a terrorist group influences the the political life of the country and the discourse of the country’s main political actors. For the purposes of this thesis, the case of Spain in its fight against the Basque separatist group ETA is taken as a situation to examine. The analysis is based on two assumptions which guide the outlook of the work: first, that we cannot assess the impact of terrorism on the political system without analyzing the discourse of the political actors and, second, that the discourse on terrorism is not created in a vacuum, but builds on the discursive elements that are present in the historical discourse of the country (culture, civilization), and, through the combination of these elements, allows us to understand the terrorist violence and provide it with meaning.  The investigation goes through three stages: the first chapter presents the main theoretical concepts and frameworks that are further used in the investigation of the role of the ETA violence in the country; then, the historical discourse on the nation and violence is studied in both Spain and the Basque Country; finally, the last two chapters examine in detail two crucial moments in reshaping of the discourse on violence, namely, signing of the Declaration of Lizarra and the electoral campaign of 2004. Here a particular emphasis is given on the influence that the events of March 11 had on the discourse.  Based on the findings of the investigation the following conclusions have been drawn: (1) democratic political actors take the elements available in the historical discourse for their respective discourse constructions; (2) democratic actors connect these different elements in the discourse according to their own needs. There are different types of logic (the logic of equivalence or the logic of difference) that can be employed in an attempt to hegemonize discourse and it is up to the democratic political actors which of them will be given priority to. However, the presence of violence often brings forth the “war frames”, i.e. the logic of equivalence, where everyone who is not with us is against us. Finally, the constructed equivalential chains are not based on neutral political divisions, but represent the moral dimension and the moral choices between good and evil.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (1069k)'}"

Starting from the assumption that the examination of what drove and hindered growth in the CEE-10 countries during accession negotiations can provide indications on how stable growth performance in these newly acceded states is, the dissertation seeks to reveal whether growth rates in the CEE-10 countries have led to income convergence within the region of the CEE-10 at national, NUTS-2 and NUTS-3 levels.   Using both qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis, the dissertation wishes to provide fresh insights into how the implementation of macro-economic policy reforms in the CEE-10 countries influenced growth performance, how the implementation of regional policy affects the spatial distribution of growth, and the extent to which growth rates in the CEE-10 countries lead to income convergence in the region.   Evidence has been found that the larger the extent of macro-economic and institutional policy reforms, the higher the expected per capita GDP growth rate of the given CEE country is. In what concerns the sub-national regions of the CEE-10, while no unconditional -convergence has been shown, considerable country dummy effects have been identified, the predicted convergence/divergence rates varying with the model specification, the level of analysis and the time period covered. Five robust convergence clubs have been found to exist at the NUTS-3 level in the region. Compared to the endogenous nature of growth processes indicated by the OLS regression models, more sophisticated results have been found using quantile regression. Namely, only the regions in the top convergence club exhibit endogenous growth, while growth in the regions in the bottom club is of neo-classical type, the picture in the three middle ranking convergence clubs is highly individual-invariant specific and is not linearly related to initial regional GDP income levels.  The findings of the dissertation highlight, among others, that when evaluating convergence rates, special attention should be paid to the choice of the appropriate level of analysis. Restraining the analysis to only the national level and neglecting sub-national processes could be misleading from the perspective of long-term growth prospects. Similarly, the model approach adopted should be considered carefully, as the widely used pooled OLS regression is insensitive to panel fragmentation and therefore to possible differences in growth processes in the case of regions with different characteristics. A possible alternative for the growth literature that is worth being explored in further research is the recently developed quantile regression analysis.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1401k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

It addresses the question of why there has been a substantial variation in the SF implementation outputs between the two countries. The research challenges the Europeanization and European cohesion policy theories by demonstrating that factors such as domestic compliance, institutional experience and administrative capacities of the implementation bodies fail to explain the Spanish success and Slovakia failure. Instead I argue that policy outputs are strongly influenced by mechanisms embedded in the implementation process. My thesis engages in an analysis which considers the structuring potential of the overarching action strategies - the way they guide and constrain the behaviour and procedural workings of the implementation process. I contend that despite an ongoing devolution of modern governance and a growing influence of non-governmental actors, the hierarchical character of policy-making has not been fully obliterated and the central policy decisions continue to shape public interventions. The empirical findings strongly support this claim. Nevertheless, the adopted analytical framework also demonstrated that top-down policy implementation process is neither strictly rationalist nor sealed from exterior pressures and procedural routines. First, the focus on policy design unveiled that public problems (Roma exclusion) are “framed” by policy-makers who act upon their own perceptions and consolidated norms. As such, it is the very representation of the problem rather than its objective assessment that legitimizes a set of adopted solutions (objectives and measure). This approach demonstrated that framing of Roma exclusion as a structural issue, free of ethnic underpinnings, is conductive to effective outputs. Second, the analysis of participatory dimension of modern governance showed that in fact overarching strategies are strongly influenced by a growing number of stakeholders, working in different configurations of partnership and located at different stages of the implementation process. However, it was also unveiled that this influence is strongly constrained by the willingness of the government to cede authority and enable participatory policy-making. Thus effective outputs were driven by fairly corporatist partnership arrangements opened to carefully selected experts and organizations. Finally, while top-down strategies and partnership arrangements are considered the main “shapers” of policy implementation effective outputs are also contingent on administrative coordination and programmatic synergies. The findings showed that linking SF programming with national and regional policy activities reinforced effective outputs - by preventing overlaps, incongruities and conflicts of interest.  This work contributes to and challenges existing scholarly discussions about implementation of the SF and social inclusion policies. It also offers a new perspective on normative claims about the general character of policy implementation by highlighting that policy outputs continue to be strongly contingent on the macro level variables that structure the entire process.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1786k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

It departs from a puzzling observation of actors, involved in the implementation of the partnership principle, strongly disagreeing with its current practice across all four countries and calling into question its existing format and advancing a variety of claims regarding possible reform of the practice. The thesis also departs from the academic puzzle of inability of existing scholarly accounts to explain the logic of contestation. It challenges the assumptions advanced by the literature on Europeanization, transposition and compliance, European civil society and partnerships in public policy as being able to capture only a small segment of complex reality of contestation and reduce it to either expression of actors’ diverse cultural origins or other ‘narrower’ properties such as interests, identities etc. To capture the logic of contestation over the partnership principle, the thesis draws on work of Antje Wiener and adapts the theoretical perspective of the theory of social construction of norms which views norms as intersubjectively constructed in the process of interactions, and which defines contestation as enactment of the structure of meaning-in-use. Meanings are seen as embedded in social practices. A new integrationist analytical framework is elaborated which views two social practices as potential reservoirs of meanings of partnership, namely, cultural, and professional backgrounds. Thus, the framework integrates diverse assumptions of exiting research literature. In empirical terms, in order to identify the logic of contestation as enactment of meanings shaped by either cultural or professional backgrounds an interpretive methodology was used. It prescribes reconstruction of meanings through immersion with the world of agents rather than pre-conceiving the sources of agents’ conceptualizations in advance. The major findings demonstrate that contrary to expectations of the existing literature, the logic of contestation over the partnership principle cannot be strictly reduced to either clash between cultural backgrounds of actors coming from different countries (cross-country divergence) or clash between diverse interests, identities or other properties of actors. It has been found that actors’ understandings of partnership are largely shaped by their common professional backgrounds and, thus, converge across countries but diverge across three groups of actors – state officials, civil society organizations and economic and social partners. The role of cultural backgrounds has been found as playing no, as in case of state officials and economic and social partners, or only some, as in case of civil society organizations, role in structuring actors’ interpretations of partnership. In other words, actors coming from the same group interpret partnership highly similarly. The findings contribute to and challenge existing scholarly discussions about Europeanization, implementation of the EU requirements and policies, and development of civil society actors in the CEE member states. The also highlight a new perspective on normative claims about European civil society and their empirical rootedness through a better understanding of contestation around the EU partnership.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2284k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

It focuses on motivation, participation and interaction patterns of one type of actors, the local governments that constitute the backbone of much institutionalized cross-border cooperation in Europe. Local governments, especially small ones, have frequently been neglected by researchers, who instead tend to focus on actors representing regional bodies or major towns. The dissertation therefore argues that more attention devoted to the attitudes and behavior of local governments can enhance our understanding of variance in function and performance of the type of institutions often referred to as Euroregions. The dissertation uses the concept of social capital (as understood by Coleman 1990) and addresses two specific questions: (1) Why and how do local governments participate in cross-border cooperation institutions (Euroregions) and how do they interact? (2) How does social capital impact the performance and function of Euroregions? The dissertation relies on an extensive dataset consisting of more than 200 interviews. The core is 138 interviews with political representatives (mayors) and organizational representatives (Chairs and Managers) of six Euroregions located along three national borders (Hungary/Slovakia, Sweden/Norway and Austria/Germany). A mixed-method approach is used in the analysis of the data, combining qualitative content analysis with social network analysis. Results demonstrate that local governments do not form or join Euroregions primarily due to policy concerns. Instead these organizations are mostly driven by a normative dimension of identity, sometimes in conjunction with the instrumental motivation to access funds, but only rarely to solve policy needs. For the creation of between-group social capital it is important that there is a fit between the motivation of the members and the range of activities a Euroregion conducts. Euroregions for which instrumental grant-seeking played an important role are less likely to reinforce and create the kind of trust-based networks that are beneficial for Euroregional performance. Inter-municipal cooperation is a resource that plays an important role both at the time of Euroregional formation and later into its operation, and dense communication networks on one side of the border are related to how active the members become in the Euroregional organization. The dissertation therefore argues that high levels of within-group social capital serve as a precondition for high levels of between-group social capital. However, evidence could not be found to support the expectation that a high level of between-group social capital in the form of cross-border communication is associated with high organizational performance in the form of cross-border cooperation intensity. Nonetheless, short-time boosting of a Euroregionâ€™s cross-border cooperation intensity (project, budget) through external grants without access to that underlying resource of social capital is risky and requires solid and skillful technical management to place it in the cross-border governance space.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (1911k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Ethics management represents a set of systematic managerial measures meant to promote integrity within an organization. With corruption recognized as a devastating governance problem world-wide, it has become a best practice standard, in both the public and business sectors, yet empirical research on its effects is scant. The thesis uses the theoretical perspective of organizational socialization, understood as a social learning process by which individuals come to appreciate the values, knowledge and expected behaviours associated to organizational roles. In this view, ethics (understood as public role morality) represents something that organizational members learn, and the structures and instruments dedicated to ethics management can feed this learning process. The thesis uses a qualitative methodology, combining document analysis with interviews with officials and ethics experts in the European Commission. Findings show that Commission employees think about ethics in largely similar terms (which is significant, given the heterogeneous nature of Commission staff), and that their reasoning incorporates the messages and concerns expressed internally through official channels (particularly in the wave of ethics awareness-raising and guidance actions implemented after 2008). However, ethics is frequently described as a matter of “common sense”; moreover, the preference, when confronted with a dilemma, is to seek advice from close colleagues and superiors (instead of using specialized structures). This indicates an indirect pattern of influence. Although ethics management instruments are not perceived as particularly relevant for day-to-day work, the Commission’s efforts in this area nevertheless have an impact, because they put ethics on the map in the internal organizational life. Thus, ethics management contributes largely indirectly to the “learning” of ethics, by problematizing the topic – staking it out as an “issue” – which stimulates employees’ sensitivity and leads to ethics questions being picked up in internal discussions. The thesis also highlights the importance of public image considerations. The Commission responded to a shattering scandal (the Santer Commission resignation) with ethics reforms that featured a hard-line approach. During Siim Kallas’ mandate (2004 – 2009), attempts were made to move closer to a “modern” system based on guidance and shared values. The switch was not entirely successful, because it implied rolling back controls, which risked being interpreted as the Commission letting its guard down. Thus, the initial framing of ethics as a cure for corruption diminished the political profitability of reforming the system later on, leading the Commission into a situation where a higher premium was placed on how it looked, rather than what it needed. In conclusion, the thesis shows that ethics management is an exercise with a double purpose – it targets the organization’s integrity, as well as its public image – and these are not (always) complementary objectives.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (982k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The cross-sector relationship was examined through the three key dimensions suggested by Shigetomi (2003): the economic space, the political space controlled by the Vietnamese Communist Party, and the efforts from INGOs to create a more favorable environment to their work. The decisive factors helping INGOs to effectively altering the environment to their favor are institutional factors, INGOs’ characteristics and the socio-cultural context of Vietnam. The research methods used were literature analysis and semi-structured interviews. It was concluded that, during post Doi Moi era, due to the dire need for resources to eliminate poverty and further integration to global economy, the Vietnamese state has employed multiple strategies to exploit resources from INGOs. At the same time, it managed to keep INGOs under close surveillance to make sure no organizations outside of state umbrella are able to challenge its legitimacy. Among the multiple tactics deployed by the state, the most crucial ones are the required link with local non-governmental organizations in the areas of INGOs’ choice, and the excessive amount of regulatory frameworks that INGO have to adhere to. Since mostly all local NGOs assigned to INGOs are an extension of the state’s apparatus, the mass organizations, this negatively affects autonomy of overseas non-state actors, as well as the growth of a genuine independent civil society in Vietnam. Local civil society actors play the most important role in promoting participatory governance and democratization (Uphoff, 1986), thus the slowdown in its development bears adverse implications on the path to better governance in Vietnam. Furthermore, if INGOs are in partnership with the closely state- elated agencies, their contribution to the expansion of democratic freedom and the changing dynamics of governance in Vietnam will not be substantial.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This report explores the meaning of genocide in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the limitations, and the main criticisms. Finding that the concepts of groups and intent are restrictive. A new framework based on a sociologist perspective on genocide will be created. Following this, it will be argued that political groups should be included as a protected category.

This framework will be applied to the cases of Aleppo and Ghouta. The possibility of religious and political opposition as being the target groups will then be considered, as well as the inhumane tactics of the regime such as using chemical weapons. Finally, it will examine the acts of evictions and policies such as Decree 66 and Article 10 that aim to prevent the safe return of certain Syrians.

With the point of departure being the digital divide conceptual framework, two important cases from the group of developing countries and their governments' ICT policies from the beginning of the 21st century until 2020 have been subject to comparative analysis.  It has been found that the more digital divide or inequality focused an ICT policy has been the better the country has scored on digital divide indices. In essence, it was found that the variance in the comparison between China and India, China being clearly better off, can be explained in parts because of China's shift in policy approach in its 11th five-year plan that has much more centered societal inequality issues to be tackled."", 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The process of its implementation, which requires regional unanimity, has since been stalled due to diverging positions on trade liberalisation of the EAC countries. In particular, Kenya supports liberalisation through the EPA and signed it single-handedly, while Tanzania opposes it, referring inter alia to the protection of domestic industries. How can these opposing positions on trade liberalisation in the form of the EPA be explained? In an attempt to answer this question, this thesis looks at a number of economic and political factors that are expected, based on literature and theory from the field of International Political Economy, to exert an influence on states’ trade preferences. In order to account for the multiple layers and of factors forming trade preferences, the thesis attempts to draw the big picture with micro-, meso-, and macro-level analyses of comparative trade profiles, economic-political power linkages and regional political bargaining. The evidence used to fill the picture with details draws on primary and secondary literature, economic data, and expert interviews. Based on the results, it appears that Tanzania’s EPA opposition hinges on its limited gains from the Agreement due to being a LDC with permanent free EU market access. This reason is complemented by the country’s historically weak industrialisation, defiance of market-liberalism and deeper regional integration; as well as its current industrialisation strategy and protectionist policies, on which economic actors have limited influence. In contrast, Kenya’s EPA support appears to be rooted in the threat of losing free EU market access as a non-LDC in combination with the historical background of industrialisation and market-liberal ideology; as well as the current economic policy of furthering external trade and deepening regional integration, in which economic actors potentially have a voice.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The research explores the potential causal mechanism of PESCO’s emergence as a problem-solving response to increasing negative externalities of insecurity. The research does not support the hypothesis that national preferences would have converged on the substantive scope of defence cooperation, thus increasing the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis of understanding PESCO as an instrument for revitalising integration.

The “disastrous” Net Energy Metering (NEM) policy to develop the solar power industry was launched in 2016 with little resistance, while the proposed B10 biodiesel mandate, introduced in 2015, was shelved due to opposition from stakeholders. Why is there a divergence in reception between the two policies? The comparative study on the policy processes found that powerful stakeholders with high-intensity preference are likely to attain their policy preference. State-owned utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), which controls the supply chain of electricity, is the single-most, powerful stakeholder in the solar power industry. It is able to push through the version of a NEM policy that safeguards its interests. The B10 biodiesel mandate policy, on the other hand, met with resistance from automakers and the logistics sector coalition. Subsequently, the implementation of the B10 mandate has been put on hold indefinitely. This study also found that there is a higher participation of stakeholders in the debate regarding the biofuel policy, which has led to a higher legitimacy for the proposed B10 mandate. However, the higher participation in the debate seems to have acted as a double-edged sword - it has slowed down the implementation of the B10 mandate.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

China’s “new era” has been characterized with more active involvement in several fields, however, this thesis will focus on the foreign development promotion. China as a “re-emerged” development partner has faced several critiques from the traditional Bretton Woods institutions. The main concerns of the West were connected with China's non-willingness to cooperate, low environmental standards, unconditional and non-transparent nature of their development assistance. These critiques highlight the broader conflict between China and the United States over China's disinclination to become a responsible stakeholder of the international system and provide global public goods. After its establishment, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) envoked the idea of China moving towards more responsible behavior in its official narrative. There is an extensive discussion and conjecture on China becoming a more responsible stakeholder, however, little of it is research based . This thesis will fill in this gap and evaluate whether the establishment of the AIIB is an indication of China’s move towards responsible international behavior. The study argues that China’s hypothetical switch towards more responsible behavior should have had an impact on Chinese policy banks, because these are the main providers of China’s financial assistance. The study will compare the official narrative and working strategies of the AIIB and policy banks of China. The main dimensions in which these institutions will be compared are environmental sustainability of the implemented projects, collaboration with Western donors and transparency of financial flows. This thesis argues that the establishment of the AIIB followed the desire to create an image of a responsible raising power and strengthen Chinese soft power; however, that image does not indicate that China has committed itself to follow norms of the international donor community. Evidence for this is the Chinese policy banks continued operation under their previous working styles. The thesis provides an evidence in support that the AIIB is following its official narrative and demonstrates working strategies similar to Western Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), while the policy banks of China are not moving towards more responsible behavior. This dual approach of using new institutions to align themselves with international norms while continuing activities that deviate from there are a hallmark of Chinese international involvement in the 21st century. Even though there have been essential improvements concerning environmental standards of domestic loans, but overseas lending is still less green, in addition non-transparent working strategies of the policy banks make China’s switch towards becoming a more responsible stakeholder quite debatable."", 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This study, the first to examine the question, concludes that there is a gender-based disparity in terrorism cases. Second, the study uses U.S. sentencing data to examine possible reasons for the observed disparity. In particular, the study considers the applicability of two hypotheses: The liberation hypothesis which suggests sentencing disparities decrease between demographic groups in terrorism cases, and the paternalism hypothesis which posit gender will have a significant influence on sentencing outcomes in terrorism-related to cases.

In Argentina, it is estimated that 16 million tons of food are wasted each year representing more than 87 million meals per day in a country where almost 32% of the population lives in poverty. According to the Banco de Alimentos de Buenos Aires (Food Bank), an Argentine non-profit organization, for every kilo of food wasted food, three people that are food insecure could eat. While food donation is one of the most effective initiatives to reduce food waste and food insecurity, liability issues have prevented donors from donating food. Many potential donors believe they will have legal problems for providing food that might affect peopleâ€™s health, even if the food is delivered in perfect conditions and complies with safety standards. This thesis aimed to answer the question of whether limiting liability of food donors encourages food donations, in order to make a case for the reincorporation of article 9 of the DONAL law (Law 25.989) in Argentina. Enacted in 2004, the law establishes a Special Regime for the Donation of Foods in good Condition, which aims to help meet the food needs of the economically most vulnerable population. Yet, Article 9 of the law that exempted donors from responsibility for food once delivered to beneficiaries under the conditions required by the Argentine Food Code was vetoed and this decision has discouraged donations in the country. The data presented in this thesis shows that food donation helps reduce food insecurity and food waste by rescuing tons of food each year and delivering meals to millions in need, hence the DONAL law should be amended to encourage donations.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I argue that this is an oversimplification. Knowledge can be partially rival and excludable, and companies routinely use secrecy to mitigate the risk of knowledge disclosure. The path of an invention from an inventor to general knowledge is far from straightforward, influenced by many factors including institutional interventions such as patents. I introduce a new property of permanency—the inability to reverse transactions with a good—to analyze how knowledge becomes a public good. To show the effects of permanency empirically, I use assignment data on over four million US patents to test the hypothesis that patents on relatively less reverse-engineerable inventions will more likely be reassigned sooner after the application date. The results of a logistic and survival regression support this hypothesis, which suggests that permanency plays a role in motivations of inventors and companies to patent. Future research on knowledge creation and disclosure and policy proposals for patent reforms thus should employ a more nuanced conceptualization of knowledge, in which permanency plays a role.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In this thesis I explore how machine learning can help to solve such and other prediction problems in public policy making and what challenges it faces. My goal is to bring the two fields closer together as most public policy makers likely do not even know that they face prediction problems that machine learning can help solving. After an introduction to prediction problems, I give an overview of how machine learning works and explain under what circumstances machine learning can be used for data-driven predictive modeling for the social good. A case study about predicting hygiene violations in restaurants illustrates the lessons learned and allows to get an idea of what applying machine learning looks like in practice. I then look into the challenges and limitations that machine predictions face in public policy making. Besides the fundamental limits of prediction, these range from technical and human challenges to ethical and legal issues due to biased predictions, black-box algorithms and questions of responsibility.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

With a sudden and huge inflow of low-skilled immigrants in the EU since the European migration crisis, it is necessary to understand how Portugal has adopted policies on skill development to build low-skilled immigrants' competencies in the European job market. With the changes in policies of immigration and skill development, it has also become important to analyze migrants' perception of skills and their strategies of adapting further skills to be employed on high-skill jobs. The purpose of the dissertation is about investigating the integration of migrants into EU labor markets. It also explores labor migration from South Asia to continental Europe in order to find gapes in European labor migration policies, and strategies used by low- skilled labors coming from South Asia. Particular emphasis is given to the case of Nepalese low-skilled migrants in exploring migrants' understanding of their skills, their strategy in attaining available skill gaining opportunity and their decision on transnational mobility after their stay in Portugal. The dissertation is structured to show the research aim, objective and methodology. The dissertation introduces Portugal and the extent of low-skilled migrants working in the Portuguese labor market. Following the literature of skill measurement and skill mismatch, the paper highlights the limited proxies used for skill measurement. With in-depth interviews with low-skilled Nepalese migrants, the research shows how migrants perceive their skills in the foreign land irrespective of their educational attainments.

It is puzzling that this party family, which traditionally is family conservative and sometimes even blatantly anti-feminist, has begun preaching for the emancipation of female Muslim immigrants. The most prominent explanation for why these parties employ gender equality rhetoric revolves around bordering who belongs to the nation and who does not, and establishing difference between what is represented as the gender equal majority population and the patriarchal (Muslim) immigrant population. In other words, scholars propose that these parties “play the gender card” in order to further their anti-immigration agenda. An interesting contribution to the scholarly debate is Sarah Farris’ political economy approach to the phenomenon. This thesis looks at how gender equality and anti-immigration discourse operate together in the Norwegian context by analyzing discourse by the Norwegian Progress Party, as well as discourse in Norway’s civic integration program and discourse by anti-Islam feminists and femocrats. My analysis is informed by Farris’ approach, and the findings are discussed in light of her findings. Overall, I find little evidence of Farris’ political economy explanation for exclusionary gender equality rhetoric, which might be explained by the fact that Norway significantly differs from the countries she has studied. I find that in Norway, gender equality rhetoric is used for anti-immigration and assimilationist purposes.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Due to its general notion and the fact that almost the entire society is either directly or indirectly affected, many different hurdles as well as political and institutional constraints have to be overcome. Previous pension system reforms in Germany can be characterised as a rather gradual transformation without a complete overthrow of the existing status quo. Although, it is tempting to think about large-scale reform proposals, the actual feasibility of each reform proposal must be noted. Adjusting the legal retirement age towards the prospective life expectancy in combination with an expansion of child related pension benefits and improved financial literacy, hold the potential to offset the negative externalities that result from the progressive ageing of the society. However, these suggestions face extensive constraints regarding their actual viability. At present, current pension policies in Germany must be characterised as mostly adhering to the status quo, providing little room for innovation and even reversing previously enacted improvements. Furthermore, a general lack of political willingness to reform can be identified. In combination with the ever growing political influence of pensioners, comprehensive pension system reform is much need in Germany however, not very likely at the moment.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Using Entman’s (1993) four-pronged approach, this paper unveils the existence of unintended negative risks to BRT systems, significant framing differences between domestic and international coverage, and the emergence of a broader sociological context within which BRT operates.

There is a need for a precise mechanism of negative conditionality that would come into force at the first signs of bad performance.

The underlying theory is that the Pygmalion Effect creates a vehicle for a manifestation of “White Fragility”: African American student academic (dis)engagement. This relationship is not well-articulated in the literature. The case study gathered in-depth qualitative data from three high schools in three cities, including: Imperial, Missouri, St. Paul, Minnesota and Jacksonville, North Carolina for the purpose of closing the Black-White achievement gap in a country where education is not equal for all. Interviews were conducted with students, teachers, professors and a former administrator. The results correlate “White Fragility” with “barriers” and/or “barriers” with “disengagement”, designating “White Fragility” as a plausible impediment to African American student learning and more specifically, Black progress in advanced coursework. The thesis concludes by providing recommendations for future research and practical implications for policy stakeholders.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Since regaining independence Georgia has made significant progress in reforming the education system. The country has undertaken several reforms designed at transforming the post-Soviet education system and creating a new system which would be in line with existing demands and be competitive in the international arena (MES, 2018). However, there are still many challenges to the quality and accessibility of education for minorities in Georgia. While statistics and researches about national minorities exist, little is studied about their educational needs in Georgia. This study attempts to fill the gap, identify core educational needs and examine causes that hinder national minority groupsâ€™ motivations to get engaged more actively into school and higher education. The research focuses on the largest minority groups in Georgia, ethnic Azeri and ethnic Armenians. By studying the issue two main specific problems are identified, access to education and the quality of that education. Qualitative research through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out. Furthermore, secondary information was collected and analyzed from various reports, strategy documents in this regard.

The gruesome nature of the crime brought national and global attention toward the pervasiveness of the child rape in the country and the failure of the subsequent national governments to provide adequate physical protection to its children. After the incident, the media, specifically print media, emerged as a crucial actor in mobilizing the masses and sensitizing them about the occurrence of such events while at the same time pressurizing the government to address the issue. Moreover, the media’s power to translate the events involving child rape into social movement for child sexual protection was tested. This thesis explores how the incidents of child rape are covered in the Indian print media by analyzing the Kathua rape case as a case study. By extensively analyzing the content of two leading Delhi-based English-language newspapers, the Times of India and the Hindu, it investigates whether the media fulfills its utmost journalistic responsibility of keeping an eye on the policies and progress related to child rape. Specifically, it looks into how media interacts with government to influence public policy regarding child rape and its role in portraying the issue to shape public opinion around it. The thesis aims to show that while the print media was instrumental in arousing public opinion on the issue of child rape and channeling public demands to the government, it failed to push the government to address loopholes in the criminal justice system of India. The thesis concludes that information media in India should further increase the visibility of sexual violence against children and challenge the prevalent social and cultural norms that promote sexual violence against children.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Using quantitative methods, this paper utilizes 2013 LSMS Integrated Household Panel Survey data, combined with disaster data from the EM-DAT International Disaster Database to study household consumption levels impacted by extended droughts or floods. The results of this study indicate that when linked with safety nets and distance to nearest agricultural markets, outcomes of diversification and consumption are significantly higher.

As a precondition to receiving the ‘bailout’ package, the Fund has urged the country to switch to the free-float exchange rate regime and let the market forces of demand and supply determine the true value of the Pakistani rupee. Consequently, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has withdrawn its support for the rupee and allowed to depreciate the country’s currency in a bid to comply with the preconditions of the IMF and also to rein in the burgeoning trade account deficit that has been spiraling out of control. Although, theoretically speaking, depreciation or devaluation would lead to an improvement in the trade balance, the decision has received mixed responses. On the one hand, the decision has been hailed as it would contain the imbalance in the external account and put the country on a higher growth trajectory, on the other hand, the effectiveness of the devaluation has been questioned as it would have limited impact on correcting the country’s trade imbalance while having negative repercussion on the country’s economy. This thesis is an attempt to empirically evaluate the effects of the currency devaluation on the imports and exports of Pakistan. Analyzing the exchange rate movement between 2004 and 2017, this study investigates the existence of S-curve in Pakistan’s trade relationship with its six major trading partners. Cross-correlational method is employed to determine whether currency devaluation is a prudent monetary policy to improve the country’s trade balance. Results demonstrate that the S-curve is evident in only half of the trade relationships of Pakistan mainly because of the country’s import dependency on capital goods and raw materials for domestic manufacturing production, low export competitiveness, and slowdown in global economic growth. The study concludes the government and the central bank of Pakistan should be careful employing foreign experience while designing domestic exchange rate policy as the country’s economic dynamics are distinctive.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

There is strong evidence to suggest that under certain circumstances human capital flight can be beneficial for all parties. However, the situation for Greece is far from ideal. Structural dynamics of the Greek labor market and recession have pushed half million of highly skilled workers abroad. Brain drain, the most serious form of labor mobility is considered now the biggest challenge for Greek policymakers. This paper explores the drivers of human capital flight for Greece and identifies high unemployment and its characteristics as the leading drivers of brain drain. In order to understand how unemployment increased emigration, two trends of labor dynamics will be examined in relation with the duration and the education level of unemployment. Furthermore, the paper explores the current strategy of the government to tackle the brain drain. The conclusion draws upon the entire thesis, tying up the various theoretical strands in order to suggest a set of recommendations that will support Greek government on reversing the brain drain into brain gain.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

It officially recognized women as an integral part of the security sector, shifting their perceived role from a weak and helpless victim to productive actors of change. Despite almost 20 years since UNSCR 1325, the resolution has failed to achieve its goals with low levels of female representation and participation, while the UN peacekeepers are themselves committing sexual and gender based violence against their female counterparts and the host population. The failure is usually attributed to the culture of militarized masculinity in UN Department of Peace (DPO) and the masculine culture prevalent in the host country resulting in institutional barriers in implementing the resolution. The thesis provides an alternate explanation which not only argues that the problematic framing of the resolution itself is the root cause of its failure, but it also paradoxically perpetuates gender inequality. The study begins by outlining the need of incorporating a gendered perspective in security sector which resulted in the passage of UNSCR 1325. Thereupon, the barriers and policy implications of the resolution are critically analyzed in terms of the problematic framing of the resolution itself, which reinforces and promotes the masculine culture by perpetuating gender stereotypes, as evidenced in the case study of UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). It concludes by recommending various policy options that the Troop contributing countries (TCCs), and the UN Department of Peace should adopt to ensure that gender equality is achieved in peacekeeping operations (PKOs) and domestic security institutions, while also highlighting the potential challenges to implementing some of these recommendations.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In the process of security sector reform the country should ensure a strategic partnership with international organizations and bilateral partners, whose assistance aims to prevent risks and threats to peace and security. But, in the same time the principle of local ownership and coordination of assistance should be emphasised and respected. Thus, the international assistance seeks to harmonize and adjust the legal and policy framework governing the security sector according to their standards. The Security Sector Reform is built on the state's ability to mitigate vulnerabilities through development and to use a range of policy tools to prevent or address security threats affecting the well-being of society.

Bangladesh has been part of this Chinese initiative since 2016. In contrast, Bangladesh’s immediate neighbor, India, has not joined the BRI yet claiming it as a threat to India’s sovereignty. Bangladesh has been enjoying earnest relations with China in terms of trade and security since 2016. India had used its hard power against Bangladesh when it joined the BRI. However, some recent trends in Bangladesh–India bilateral relations have occurred regardless of Bangladesh’s membership in the BRI. This thesis aims to evaluate the recent trends in the bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India, given the BRI context. This thesis seeks to analyze how Bangladesh and India have been dealing with each other after Bangladesh joined the BRI. The Recent trends in Bangladesh–India bilateral relations are explored in terms of trade, security, and the India Ocean region. This thesis finds and shows that since 2016 India has moved from hard power projection to soft power in dealing with Bangladesh. Thus, Indian policymakers are also trying to sustain warm relations with Bangladesh. Finally, this thesis recommends that the Bangladesh government should follow the policy of no inclination to a single country and the pragmatist outlook in its foreign policy formulation so that it can maintain warm relations with every country.', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Recently, the Chinese policy-makers at the municipal level began to turn their focus to waste management en masse. In many Chinese cities, the informal waste recycling industry had already marketized during the years of development despite administrative constraints. However, a full-fledged market-based waste industry still failed to be established. This thesis sets out to discuss waste management policy in Chinese cities in the background of the circular economy and to provide empirical evidence gathered from the field using a case study of Shanghai. From government open data and qualitative interviews with a practitioner in the industry, this thesis finds that the Shanghai government’s failure to recognize existing rules and systems of the recycling business and include the informal system into the new waste management chain are the reasons behind the lack of a market-based industry in Shanghai.

Solving the issue not only generates more production in the economies of countries, but also has a potential to empower women and terminate intergenerational poverty. To empirically investigate the extent to which more accessible childcare leads to increased female employment, this work uses data from a conditional cash transfer program conducted in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

Utilizing the randomized control trial setting of the program, this thesis uses difference-in-difference method that takes into account any pre-program differences and exterior shocks to measure the relationship of interest.

Established 20 years ago as a voluntary cooperation initiative on higher education cooperation in Europe, the BP has set important policy objectives for national higher education systems and Europe at large. While government representatives, through the ministerial meetings constantly agree on what they should implement in their national higher education systems, implementation reports show considerable differences between countries and higher education institutions (HEIs) with regard to implementation. Starting with the early stages of the BP scholarly work has demonstrated that there is an increasing interest in studying the different dimensions of BP implementation. A considerable amount of these studies has focused on assessing and explaining the different levels of BP implementation yet there is a gap in addressing the implementation of the BP from an integrated perspective. This dissertation aimed to fill this gap and asked What are the factors explaining the different levels of implementation of higher education policies within the Bologna Process? First of all, this dissertation seeks address the research gap by focusing on specific policy areas within the BP (quality assurance and the social dimension), diverse county contexts and higher education institutions within such contexts (Moldova, Portugal, and Romania). Secondly, it aims to contribute to the broader policy implementation literature by providing a conceptual understanding of policy implementation, by breaking it into adoption, transposition and practical implementation, and by putting forward an integrated set of factors for each of the three implementation stages, and empirically test them through semi-structured interviews. The dissertation hypothesizes three causal mechanisms for each of the implementation levels. Firstly, is hypothesized that adoption is the result of policy fit between commonly agreed policies at the BP level and national preferences and interests, as resulted through national representatives’ participation in BP. The causal model predicts that if BP policies have the support of top domestic actors and structures, this may push the national policies closer to the ones promoted by the BP. As a result, BP structures prefer to collaborate with those domestic actors who are in favor of its policies. Secondly, specific to the transposition stage it can be hypothesized that mutual learning and other socialization processes equip governmental agencies and bodies, societal actors, and the academic community with information about the main developments at the EHEA level and contribute to national level policy-making by feeding back national policy makers, affecting the choice for specific policy instruments and implementation mechanisms. Last but not least, at the HEIs level rectors and top-managers, academic and administrative staff, and students develop institutional plans and policies in line with the national level policies or the BP depending on their participation as stakeholders in the policy-making processes, autonomy and the added value of the policies in question. First of all, this dissertation highlighted the complex relationship between the BP, national, and institutional policy-making and the importance of national and institutional (interest) structures, actors (coalitions) and processes in connecting these levels. While it is assumed that that there is a “filter” when it comes to the implementation the BP commitments, with each level and layer of policy-making preconditioning the following (adopting the necessary legislation, transposition and institutional practices) this dissertation has shown that this is very much dependent on the policy in question. Quality assurance (QA) is a rather structural and technical area, with clear conceptualizations and operationalizations, with structures and bodies at the European, national and institutional level, whereas the social dimension (SD) is underdeveloped in this respect. HEIs implement QA policies because of the competitive environment they have to operate in but also because of the existent monitoring mechanisms (at the institutional, national and BP level). The SD is a rather sensitive area, with most of the universities putting forward their preferred approaches on how to deal with such issues. If in the case of QA in most of the country cases there is a national level agency which pushes for implementation at the HEIs level, in the case of SD the situation is loose.', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

This dissertation challenges this prevalent assumption and argues that variables mediating diffusion matter – not only as enablers of the process but also as potential hinderers. It studies the mediating role of domestic epistemic communities (groups of experts whose knowledge leads them to pursue a common policy goal) on the adoption of international policy trends. It finds that the central scope condition for the adoption of the communities’ preferred policies is decision-makers’ demand for their input. This is in contrast to existing scholarship, which assumes that decision-makers necessarily follow epistemic communities’ advice when facing complexity and uncertainty. These findings result from a fresh look at the universe of cases of policy diffusion and epistemic communities’ influence that includes negative cases, often ignored in literature and policy debates, in addition to the well-analyzed positive ones. This dissertation studies the diffusion (and non-diffusion) of health technology assessment (HTA) agencies. HTA agencies are public bodies that evaluate available evidence on the medical, economic, ethical, legal, social and other aspects of health interventions – drugs, medical devices, diagnostic procedures, surgical interventions and the like. In a textbook case of policy diffusion, they have since the late 1980s spread from a handful of early adopters to most countries in Western Europe (leading to a “success bias” of the practitioner literature on HTA similar to the one prevalent in diffusion theory), but not to most Central and Eastern European countries. The dissertation is composed of three independent papers which each examine the reasons for the halted diffusion of HTA agencies. Their findings are based on a set of 77 interviews with key health policy actors and document analysis. Paper I establishes a chronological taxonomy of HTA agencies in the European Union. It finds structural variables unsatisfactory to explain the pattern of their diffusion, and proposes an alternative explanatory model focusing on the role of actors, more specifically domestic epistemic communities. Paper II tests this model empirically based on the Polish and Czech cases: Poland established an HTA agency in 2005, while the Czech Republic does not have one, despite a debate in 2011-2013. It finds a clear influence of the domestic epistemic community in both countries, which was, however, in the Czech Republic, moderated by a lack of policy-makers’ demand for expert input. Paper III studies health policy actors’ interests and policy positions regarding delegation of pricing and reimbursement competences to an HTA body in the Czech case, and confirms the key place of policy-makers’ demand. It concludes that interests of actors (including the epistemic community of “aspiring agents”) are close to irrelevant, as long as the principals do not perceive the need for expertise. Concluding remarks of the dissertation note the near non-existence of sound policy evaluation of HTA and suggest that policy-makers’ willingness to listen to HTA epistemic communities may have more to do with their modernizing ambitions than with HTA’s unclear achievements in improving the quality, equity or sustainability of health systems.'}"

Specifically, the thesis engages with the dynamics of resource extraction in the context of formalised artisanal and small-scale mining, which has received limited attention in the literature. This is done through three independent but interconnected, publishable articles based on archival research, interviews and field visits to Zambia’s amethyst and emerald mines. The first chapter is a co-authored, published article and evaluates the link between formalisation, as a formal institutional intervention, and economic outcomes for formalised artisanal and small-scale emerald miners. The study finds that contrary to indications in the literature, formalisation has not resulted in increased access to credit, investment or state assistance. Conversely, the state employed formalisation as a tool for centralising control over mineral-rich areas while displacing artisanal miners to marginal lands. In the second chapter, the thesis explores how mining licence-holders respond to institutional failures to support their activities. The study finds that ‘competing’ informal institutions have emerged around resource extraction that undermine the government’s goals of revenue generation and miners’ goals of poverty-reduction. In the third and final chapter, the viability of mining associations in facilitating collective action in response to common production constraints by miners is assessed. The chapter discovers that mining licence-holders rely more on informal, trust based networks than mining associations, which face internal governance and capacity constraints and low levels of trust. The thesis importantly demonstrates how the introduction of formal institutional frameworks, in the form of policies and laws, has limited impact on increasing access to benefits from resources by communities. Formal institutional interventions, primarily favour actors with pre-existing capital to benefit from resources while the poor continue to rely on informal institutions.', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Based on thirteen months of participant observation in three research sites, it argues that the boundary between the formal and the informal is fuzzy, and is dependent on the meaning-making actors' positionality, power and performativity. As an interdisciplinary project at the crossroads of political science and social anthropology, this dissertation proposes a grounded theory in which informality functions as a communicative vehicle in the process of policy translation among local and non-local actors. Informality has been associated with reproduction �from below� – seen as residual to formalizing initiatives of state – and as an exclusive product of local actors. My research goes counter to these claims in that it sees the two domains as interrelated and a product of interaction between local and international actors. To the landscape of phenomena attached to the qualifier 'informal', including informal practices, institutions, networks, and informal governance, I add the concept of 'informal prism'. Challenging the assumptions in earlier informality studies, the concept of informality as a prism moves beyond the binary of formal/informal, the static normative labeling of informality as inherently a less desirable domain of human activity, and finally the normative residualism implicit in most studies on the subject of informality. Bringing on board the anthropological literature, the research contrasts the experience-distant concepts related to informality (such as corruption, networking, social capital, and clientelism) with the emic terms used in Bosnia: štela (local colloquial term for 'connections' and their use), ko fol (litt. 'as if') and ubleha (litt. 'bluff'). The dissertation traces informality locally, within an international agency, and in interaction between the international agency and its local counterparts. The main research site is the OSCE, where I explore the relationship between informality and internationality as a practice. The second site is formed by the local counterparts of the OSCE, namely 'local communities'(MZs, mjesne zajednice), semi-formal organizations that originated as a neighborhood-level governance in socialist Yugoslavia. In interaction between the OSCE and the MZs, I analyze the informal prism through the process of translating down, in which the local intermediaries interpret the etic language of informality into those emic concepts that the 'internationals' oppose. The third site is a network of NGOs united in an anti-corruption movement ACCOUNT. Here I observe the complementary process of translating up of informality through a series of performances of the local actors aimed at the international audience. The theoretical implications of this research reach over four broad areas of investigation: (1) theories of informality in social sciences; (2) critical state-building literature; (3) interpretive policy analysis and critical policy studies; and (4) area studies on the Balkans and Bosnia. While the primary goal of my research has not been policy-driven, and has been more concerned with challenging taken-for-granted normative ideas rather can creating new ones, there is a set of lessons learnt that address the policy-making world. These can be grouped into: (1) informality management within an international bureaucratic apparatus deployed in a contact zone; and (2) informality management on the local ground.""}"

A vehicle for delivering welfare-enhancing public goods to Europeans, the CCP has evolved along a logic of gradual trade liberalization and a shift towards regulatory cooperation since the creation of the WTO. This agenda had gone largely uncontested in Europe. It wasn’t until the EU moved to agree a deep and comprehensive free trade and investment agreement with the United States that this changed. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) embodied a newfound politicization of trade which swept over the CCP as a force majeure, questioning the objectives and underlying standards of legitimacy of the CCP. I set out to answer the question of whether this phenomenon of politicization triggered EU institutions within the CCP to pursue changes in policy goals, institutional arrangements, and modes of operation. While it seems obvious that EU institutions have to respond to politicization in a meaningful way, I demonstrate that the core policy objectives of the CCP have proved to be quite resilient. The EU trade élite’s commitment to upholding the post-WTO liberal consensus has in fact translated into a preference for circle-fencing the CCP’s core objectives and de-politicizing trade. This has meant that institutional changes in anticipation of and in response to politicization have followed a logic of incremental change, whereby the EU trade élite has tried to reconcile its institutionalized trade preferences with public resistance to these. Bizarrely, the CCP is arguably more throughput legitimate as a result while there has been little change in substantive policy preferences.  I set out to make this argument with the help of a theoretical framework derived from different strands of new institutionalisms used in combination with each other for better analytical purchase. My expectations are developed with the help of a process-tracing research design. I trace the evolution of the CCP from the Constitutional Convention on the Future of Europe taking place between 2001 and 2003 to the European Court of Justice’s landmark 2/15 Ruling in 2017 on trade competences. I rely on primary source documents and a set of (N44) élite interviews conducted with a wide range of EU decision-makers from the institutions. The exercise in process tracing reveals that while anticipation of increasing public interest did play a part in shaping the CCP’s post-Lisbon ruleset (as the European Parliament was empowered as a veto-player to make trade more legitimate) once the floodgates broke open, the Lisbon ruleset proved inadequate to de-politicize trade. The struggle to save the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada – which had become first test case for comprehensive New Generation Trade Agreements – drove a series of institutional changes which not only rebalanced the power relationship between the institutions, but also led to a more streamlined institutional structure for the CCP. One which is better equipped to side-step politicization should it flare back up in the future.', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Around the same time, groups of people living with HIV also began to form and embryonic movements appeared. More than ten years later it was clear that these movements had achieved significant influence in the form of new laws and changed cultural understandings of their communities, and that the environment for civil society and citizen voice had changed significantly. I embarked on this research to better understand the import of these movements, and in particular how, as highly marginalized citizens, they had managed to get the one-party state to listen. Rather than focussing on dissident and opposition movements, I was far more interested in how regular citizens were interacting with the state, and how and why the state was responding. This dissertation considers the question of how social movements in a one-party state can achieve policy outcomes through in depth case studies of three movements: the movement of people living with HIV; the movement of people with disabilities; and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual movement. Social movement theory has been developed based largely on empirical studies of protest movements in ‘Western’ democratic countries. The findings of this project indicate that this is a problem. I find that theory is currently unable to explain these non-protest movements in a non-democratic environment. The study critiques a number of key theoretical concepts; for example finding that framing is not simply a tool for achieving other policy goals, or a condition explaining policy success, but is an integral part of the movements’ desired outcome. In addition, findings contribute to theory building around the key role of public opinion and the media for movement outcomes, despite the non-democratic context. The findings suggest that theory will be improved if researchers consider a wider range of movements and a variety of contentious tactics, in a variety of political environments.  The study also by necessity considers the question of why elites in Vietnam have been so responsive to these movements. In a democratic environment, political response to movements is assumed to be electoral; elected representatives are responsive if and when they fear losing power. In a non-democratic environment, the question of elite response cannot be so easily glossed over. The research finds that while utilitarian authority maintenance mechanisms are relevant; far more important are characteristics of political & administrative culture, the morals and ideas of individual decision makers, and entrenched systems of power and resources. These insights are also likely relevant in democratic environments and offer exciting opportunities for future research.  Through consideration of the dynamic interactions between citizens, elite decision makers, media and international agents, the study goes beyond consideration of social movement outcomes to offer insight into how the one-party state is changing and learning as part of the fascinating live experiment in governance that is currently being conducted in Vietnam.

Since 2011, EU employment policy coordination is integrated into a new streamlined framework for policy coordination and monitoring – the European Semester. The Semester integrated three goals: to ensure sustainability of public finances, to prevent macroeconomic imbalances and to stimulate structural reforms (incl. employment). The purpose of this PhD thesis is to describe to what extent the Semester matters for national employment policy, and to explain through which mechanisms and under which conditions it influenced employment policy changes in Central and Eastern Europe. The analytical framework extracts three potential mechanisms of Semester influence on policy change: external pressure, mutual learning and creative appropriation (usage of the Semester). Each mechanism is considered to be operational only if contributing factors are present. In contrast, inhibiting factors might block or diminish the Semester’s influence through the specific pathway. For each mechanism, several structural and actor-centred factors are hypothesized. The framework observes three levels of policy change or the depth of Semester impact: parametric recalibration of the policy settings, introduction of new policy solutions and paradigmatic shifts.  This contribution resorts to contextualized process-tracing in order to track causal pathways and to control for alternative explanations of policy change and inertia/resistance. The empirical analysis rests on four country cases, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia. They were chosen based on several selection criteria to represent regional diversity, which allows for a broader generalization to the region. The study takes a longitudinal perspective and covers the period between 2011 and 2018. Empirically, this study observes the degree of fit between EU preferences, exemplified by the yearly list of country-specific recommendations, and national policy responses to EU suggestions, as described within the National Reform Programmes, and traces the extent to which policy change can be attributed to the influence of the Semester. Primary documents are used as an initial mapping device to locate individual policy items. They are complemented by 51 expert interviews conducted with Commission officials and desk officers, government officials, senior civil servants, EMCO members, social partners and NGO members.  The findings confirm the importance of external pressure within the Semester, especially in circumstances of high adaptational pressure. Yet, the study exposed the limitations of implicit conditionality as the level of recorded influence was limited. The Semester did not revert existing trajectories in labour market policies, nor was it able to cause radical shifts towards retrenchment or recalibration of employment policy. The contribution finds only limited evidence of policy change through mutual learning. Despite the institutional innovations and greater learning potential of Semester’s institutional setup, the EMCO environment must be more ‘learning-friendly’, and political levels must engage more directly in policy deliberation and foster better ties with EMCO members to reap fruits from the Semester. The greatest impact was felt indirectly through creative appropriation. Governments extensively made strategic use of the Semester by selectively choosing EU stimuli which fit the domestic agenda, thus confirming the importance of domestic (policy) ownership of reform processes among political elites.', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

It focuses on transition countries sharing similar starting conditions and external pressures, yet different results in the translation process; Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia, which all experienced direct Communist party control over universities prior to 1989. After 1989, they reformed HE governance by introducing organizational autonomy for universities, reacting to state centralization. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, they implemented reforms under the influence of the ‘modernization agenda’ spread by major international organizations; the World Bank, OECD, UNESCO-CEPES, and European Commission. The use of the ‘modernization agenda’ is studied in changes made between 1988 and 2012 in three policy areas representing three dimensions of HE governance: university relationship with state (changes to funding and property use), university internal management (centralization of university internal management and organization), and university relations with wider society (introduction of university boards). These processes are explored through the theoretical lenses of historical and sociological institutionalism, underscoring the importance of domestic institutions in the translation of international models. The former approach points to the importance of historical legacies, while the latter concentrates on how rules of appropriateness structure actor behavior. The dissertation is based on qualitative analysis of data from 121 semi-structured interviews, and 97 documents produced by proponents and opponents of changes in these countries. Analysis of the data lead to three key findings, contributing to scholarly research, and possibly informing policymaking practice, as follows: - It demonstrates the productiveness of a rarely used approach; combining the logic of appropriateness and historical institutionalism. These approaches complement each other. The former increases the explanatory power of historical institutionalism through the concept of legitimacy, helping to explain the openness of an institution to change, and the shape that change takes. The latter shows how changes viewed as legitimate will not materialize if actor behavior is bound by legacies. - It enriches the literature on HE reforms, especially in the understudied post-communist region. It provides two novel points, when showing that HE governance reforms following regime change were not built on legacies of communism and the pre-communist era, but were a reaction to the communist system. Additionally, legacies produced by critical juncture in the early 1990s critically influenced the translation of the ‘modernization agenda’ decades later. It also shows that the relevance of the Bologna model is overestimated (no Bologna reforms have been used in the three studied areas). - Policymakers can learn that during the institution design process, establishment of rigid positions by actors with potential later influence over policies should be avoided, and that during institutional change substantive energy needs to be devoted not only to policy design, but also to limiting the impact of reform opponents. Also, international recommendations can only be successful if they recognize what national reformers perceive as appropriate, and if reformers have real influence over policy adoption process.'}"

These elements matured over time, reflecting the aim to increase the Union’s external impact. However, the relationship with Russia is also characterized by an inherent lack of external coherence. The EU has ongoing difficulties to coordinate the interests of different political stakeholders and policies vis-à-vis Moscow. This thesis explores the reasons for the EU’s lack of external coherence. For that purpose, it develops a dual analytical approach that distinguishes between policy setting and policy content. Consistent with institutionalist research agendas, the policy setting highlights bureaucratic structures, rules and procedures to explain policy outcomes. In contrast, the policy content emphasizes substance and objectives of policies. The central conceptual move of the thesis is the application of Arnold Wolfers’ concept of milieu and possession goals to the specific context of EU foreign policy to investigate the relation between policy content and external coherence. Using the examples of external energy and human rights policies, domains in which the lack of coherence towards Moscow is arguably most visible, the thesis has three main findings. First, the ongoing quest for coherence is not a marginal normative claim but practically incorporated in the EU foreign policy context. It reflects a broad consensus that the degree of coherence is positively related to the effectiveness of the external approach. ‘Coherence matters’ since it responds directly to structural deficiencies prevalent in the area of EU foreign policy: external unity is inherently challenged by the functional fragmentation of the institutional structure. Coherence has become a guiding principle that promotes coordination to overcome these problems and increase the external impact of the EU. Second, external coherence is undermined by constant coordination failures between the varied interests of political stakeholders. Different reforms and modifications to formal procedures and informal processes sought to make the policy setting more conducive to coordination. While there is much evidence for positive effects on policy outcomes, there are also examples that illustrate the opposite. External coherence is undermined by partly insufficient coordination mechanisms and inexpedient institutional reform. Third, an analysis of the policy content depicts the EU as a milieu shaper towards Russia. In rebuilding and consolidating relations it seeks to shape the external environment based on norms and values. Particularly visible in the domains of energy and human rights, external coherence is lacking where norms and values are challenged or not sufficiently operationalized. In addition, the EU as a milieu shaper faces constant tensions between milieu and possession goals. A lack of coherence is prevalent in those policy episodes and areas where the tensions can neither be avoided nor resolved. Case studies reveal that the sequencing of objectives is crucial: external coherence is more likely to be achieved where milieu goals further possession goals rather than the other way around. These insights inform the formulation of recommendations in the conclusions that can help design more coherent external policies. Moreover, understanding the EU as a milieu shaper contributes to the debate on the Union’s identity as an international actor.'}"

Rather than discussing ‘softening’ as a sign of cultural identity loss and total rejection of hegemonic masculinity, I argue that these young male performers and fans distance themselves from culturally defined masculinity constructions simply to explore alternative gender identities.

These processes have inspired the rise of various Islamic-themed genres in popular culture and in cultural performances. In this thesis I focus on one such manifestation, i.e. Indonesian charity concerts, as a recent social and cultural phenomenon. To unpack the local aims that the events fulfil I trace the various forces, agents, and interests which have contributed to the emergence of charity concerts as a regular pattern in contemporary Indonesian public life. I also explore Islam-inspired notions in relation to the events, such as jihad, dakwah, and the idea of virtue, and I question how these notions fit into the social imaginaries that are projected in the charity concerts. In combining hermeneutics with ethnographic fieldwork in order to provide a ‘thick description’, I examine how Palestine and America, as two non-Indonesian, symbolic geographies, have become incorporated into local narratives drawing on global social imaginaries that are projected and performed in the concerts. How are these symbolic geographies instrumental in the global social imaginary of the ummah as well as in the imaginary of the Indonesian nation and its role within the wider (Muslim) world? I argue that the religious significance of Jerusalem and its current occupied status have ignited a form of vicarious nationalism among Indonesian Muslims, whereby Palestine is appropriated as a sacred space of belonging that demands Muslims’ allegiance to it as well as to its Palestinian inhabitants, who are regarded as fellow members of the ummah in dire need of rescue. America, on the other hand, represents not only a geographical area where Islamophobia skyrockets but also a modern global power and a gateway for the Muslim world (in particular Indonesia) to establish good ties with the West and contribute to world peace. Analyzed relationally, these events embody a form of globally oriented dakwah which projects an image of Indonesia as a model Muslim nation ready to peacefully ‘conquer’ the world with its emphasis on Islam rahmatan lil alamin, the Islam that brings mercy to all mankind.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1275k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Restricted access for years', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

While current labor studies focus mostly on the impact of neoliberalization on labor, this thesis demonstrates that experiences of workers, engaged in cultural production in authoritarian states, are conditioned by the state’s endeavor at reproduction of symbolic order and marginalization of those in conflict with the hegemonic state project as well. For this reason, labor of journalists under authoritarian neoliberal regime is characterized as “politically” and “economically” precarious, and these two dimensions of precarity are closely intertwined. Journalists simultaneously face lack of stable contracts, employment insecurity, menace of media outlets being shut-down and even life threat. This research discusses how independent journalists in Russia experience and articulate these insecurities, related to specific economic and political contexts in which their labor is placed. The thesis demonstrates that political dimension of precarity, engendered by the authoritarian regime, is treated by journalists as the most problematic, whereas economic insecurities, albeit solidly present, tend to be ignored. Among the reasons for non- acknowledgement of the economic dimension of precarity are specific understanding of labor journalists share, their liberal ideologies, strong affective bindings to a job, widespread among cultural workers, and privileged class positions.

The attitudes towards the past is also brought about by frustration over the post-Marcos administrations that failed to bring significant positive socio-economic and political outcomes. This research also shows that though the Post- Marcos and Anti-Marcos groups have non-clashing notions of ideal democracy and participate in similar forms of democratic participation, what sends them clashing are their political ties, values, and beliefs that undermine democratic consolidation.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (513k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

It is especially true if difference and differentiation are conceived at the level of optics – entailing emerging and circulating classifications and conceptions of (in)commensurability – instead of representations. The state border between Belarus and Lithuania, in many of its parts inhabited by Polish population from both sides, constitutes a distinctive example of a restricted geopolitical border – the external one of the EU – that replaced clearly formal and not corresponding to any existed cultural division – yet not inconsequential – administrative line from the Soviet times. The local effect of the state-work in the production of estrangement is examined in the thesis, as well as the circulating notions of the meaning(lessness) of the border. One scrutinised dimension of this process is the emotional experience of the factual separation, established by restrictive visa regimes and border control. On the other hand, emotional modalities, through which personal experiences of the divide are expressed, are tightly interconnected with ‘the sense of border’ at its ideational level. This, in turn, leads to further exploration of the dynamics of the popular conceptualisation of the emerged difference, expressed through the vocabulary of ‘civilizational’ and geopolitical meanings produced by the states and utilised by popular political imagination. Further on, possibiliеties of critical engagement with both existing scholarship on post-socialist borders and the ontological turn in anthropology are outlined.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (523k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I depart from a Gramscian analysis of sectarianism as a historically and politically situated power-sharing mechanism wielded by Lebanese political elites to determine and perpetuate the economic, social, and ideological positions of their members. Within a dialectical framework of resisting sectarianism through political participation, I investigate the possibilities of emergence and conditions of resistance for counter-hegemonic movements in Lebanon. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Beirut, I mobilize the case study of the self-proclaimed counter-sectarian civil society movement “Beirut Madinati.” In particular, by interrogating the inner-workings of “Beirut Madinati,” I argue that this oppositional movement’s ability to resist is hinged on its access to and consumption of a neoliberal sectarian space, economy, and formal discourse, which led to its counter-hegemonic paralysis. Vis-à-vis the case of counter-sectarianism in Beirut, I conclude by emphasizing that instead of focusing solely on the conceptual ideological terrain of resistance, it is imperative to re-imagine scholarly and activism connotations of resistance to include its pragmatic materialization in its situated spatial context.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1334k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Such general process, defined by a departure from exclusively institutional religious worldviews towards more diverse ones, is in tune with what occurs at the latin american/regional and local levels; and yet at the same time it’s also far from being homogeneous to all social realities in which it takes place, as the Peruvian case provides also with examples. Given this contrasting relationship between the local and the global, it is worth questioning as to what is the cause (or causes) attributable for these shared differences in form, but not in content. In the present thesis, I will address this question in arguing that religious socialization experiences, in the form of Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs onwards), are one of the main conditioners for shaping contemporary Peruvian religious and secular worldviews. CREDs are related to instances of observable behavior from an individual’s peers that generate an impact on them, based on how they act accordingly to what is stipulated in their respective religious belief systems or expressed religious convictions. In turn and over time, different CREDs will allow for the acquisition, maintenance or relegation of religious belief and their negotiations, which give rise to diversified worldviews.  For this purpose, I have placed as unit of analysis the age group of Peruvian young adults, (18-29 y.o.) all of them being university students located in Lima-Peru, since, as it will be argued, Peruvian youth within this age group experiences religious socialization in differentiated ways to previous generations, namely, in their general socialization experiences; in the accessing of novel media elements; in the engagement of social movements; and, in the adoption of a consumer ethos.  An interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological approach will be the basis for the elaboration of the argument, in which concepts from the fields of Cognitive Science of Religion and Sociology (in the form of theories of religious socialization) will serve as analytical tools; while grounded techniques based on Q-methodology have been used for the data gathering process of 320 surveys, 43 q-sorts, and 43 structured interviews. As a result of this exploration, a preliminary proposal of ideal-type models of religious and secular worldviews will be outlined.

The Punjabi interests are not as monolithic as postulated by detractors and this creation of a fantastical monolithic Punjab through demagoguery and Punjab-bashing statements in minority regions have hindered a full understanding of the devastation that the biopolitical activities of the sort carried out can have on a nation-state that is as ethnically divided as Pakistan. The findings of this essay are based on seven interviews from people involved in the census all over Punjab but based in Lahore, along with document analysis, analysis of news reports in print and on television, and theoretical research primarily based on the works of Foucault, Deleuze, Appadurai, Rabinow and Rose, and Agamben.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (824k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Using postcolonial and critical approaches, my research will focus on Tam-awan’s concept of a “living museum” to problematize the correlation between authenticity and the process of preservation, exhibition, commodification and mummification of a culture. I will explain how cultural preservation, when enabled by commodification, results not into the maintenance of the said culture but instead, the birth of a new culture, and hence, the creation of new authenticities based on the icons and memories of the traditional one. To understand this phenomenon, the commodification process and issues on authenticity will be examined from (1) the Cordillerans’ standpoint as regards their active participation, negotiation, and collaboration in the process of commodifying their own way of life and (2) the perspective of the museumgoers or the consumers of the commodified culture.

By examining the magazineâ€™s writings, this research illuminates their notions of poverty, homelessness, social inclusion, the role of the state and other safety net institutions. It sheds a new light on how the magazine is used as a platform for opening the questions on discrimination, poverty and mental health issues not discussed in the mainstream media. As such, the magazine serves as a tool for subversive social activism. However, this research also shows that despite the often radical rhetoric, the magazine still implies neoliberal work ethic on its vendors. The interviews with the magazine employees uncover troubling situation with the state institutions and the collapse of the safety net, and the attempts that the magazine is doing to offer support to its vendors. Such support often goes beyond a basic selling training, taking the role of the missing state institutions particularly regarding various trainings for job search and mental health support. Finally, the interviews with the vendors question the market model imposed on them, and ideas of sale efficiency as a mean to improve their social condition during the post-socialist transformation. I argue that the magazine LiceUlice is a valuable platform for both, social activism and support of its vendors, but it also reveals the extent of the neoliberal devastation of the state social institutions, overwhelming poverty and social stratification, and insecurity and risk that marginalised groups face daily in Serbia.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (545k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Through the lens of food, I wish to look into the assertion and reclamation of agency by the women from the very kitchens where the gendered division of labour often relegates them to. This will gauge the process of changing gender dynamics within families, along with a change in the perceived notions of femininity and womanliness of the displaced women. The argument is two-fold—contextualizing the creation of a new cuisine which neither was the part of the displaced community nor was consumed by the previous inhabitants of Delhi, but later went on to become synonymous to the quintessential ‘Punjabi’ food, making national and global presence, and; exploring the simultaneous evolution of food and identity of the refugees as a character. The debate on the authenticity of the cuisine has been questioned and challenged by employing the socio-cultural dynamics of nostalgia, and the economic implications of recreation and innovation.

However, these struggles are also about much more than housing: they are struggles for citizenship, for the right to be decommodified, and for being recognized as legitimate political subjects. This thesis mostly draws on two concepts, that of citizenship and that of civil society. I consider debtors’ struggles as acts of citizenship – as struggles for the right to be decommodified and for the right to have political voice. Nevertheless, my intention is to think about these acts of citizenship as being embedded within a historically bound and relational space: civil society. Through this conceptualization, this thesis aims to go beyond the narratives which describe debtors’ struggles as ‘neonationalist’, and to show how citizenship is also characterized by more than a mere relation to the state. My empirical data demonstrate that apart from contesting the elite-state projects and the emerging welfare regimes, debtors’ struggles are also positioned by and devoted to challenging the hegemonies within civil society and the country’s global capitalist integration.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1270k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Through enactive ethnography and interviewing, I study the practices of members of a public speaking club and inquire how the social conditions at the club create a possibility for the members to experience a transformation from being shy in their practices to becoming a confident public speaker. I find that the sense of position, which otherwise remains affect-neutral in Bourdieu’s account, is marked by an affective grip in the case of club members, especially my interviewees. I find this affect to be located on a continuum that ranges from shyness to confidence and driven by a categorical difference in the nature of fear that drives their practices. The genesis of habitus transformation on this continuum takes place at the point where these members begin to see the fear of failure as a fear that is limited to and directed toward an activity as against a fear that is related to the presence of other members and encompasses the failure of their whole self.

This question lies at the heart of my research on home making practices of Roma from Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg county, many of whom have migrated repeatedly: from rural to urban areas in Hungary, from Hungary to Canada and back again. Home-making as the focus of the thesis contains many important dimensions- identity, belonging, integration, politics, spatiality and temporality. Interrogating these dimensions, I argue, we can better understand the impacts of migration on home-making and vice versa. My BA thesis was dealing with Roma migration inside Hungary, how Roma people could preserve their cultural identity moving from the countryside to the capital city in the 1980s. My current research continues and expands the interest as it newly sheds light on the migration of Roma people from Hungary to Canada (started from 2008) and then back to Hungary after 2012. The Roma return migrants’ situation in Hungary is an understudied phenomenon, hence my thesis aims to fill this gap. Roma are the biggest minority in Europe facing discrimination in housing, education, health and employment related issues. Therefore, my thesis answers the following questions: How do Roma people as a community living on the margins imagine home? Have Roma persons ever felt themselves at home in Hungary? How do they create a new home in Canada and then in Hungary? How do space and time impact on their sense of home? How does migration impact their identity and belonging? According to my main findings living on the margins affects significantly the Roma people’s sense of home, because many of the informants were claiming that they do not feel themselves at home neither in Hungary, nor in Canada. Creating the material needs of home is easier in Canada because the state gives them financial support, but as they were saying “the roots are in Hungary, in my village where I came from…and it is impossible to find or create the roots in Canada” (Klaudia, 51).', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (385k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Three ways of connecting to the communal feeling are based on the “village” (falu) metaphor: class composition, ethnic belonging, and tangible heritage. I explore the coded clarity of this ethnicized and eventually romanticized idea of belonging, which signifies the Jewish identities of Újlipótváros. Subsequently, I hone in on local class belonging with an analysis of recent gentrification processes in the neighbourhood.

The study is based on semi-structured interviews with seven women born in the 1960s and 1970s, who started to run small-scale businesses in Mezhdurechensk in 1990s and 2000s while being young mothers, as well as on archival materials such as local newspapers and official statistics. Doing business offered women flexibility in structuring the workday to combine it with the household work, which has been considered women’s duty. I focus in my research on two important historical turns: the 1990s as the birth of entrepreneurship, and 2008 as a moment of snowballing crisis and vulnerability. The continuing macro-changes affecting Mezhdurechensk made female entrepreneurs, who started to run business in early post-Soviet time, to adopt and eventually re-consider their working tactics. Mothers’ decisions to become entrepreneurs can be understood both by looking at their life courses, and by embedding their individual biographies in the broader transformations of the post-Soviet gender regime. The entrepreneurial subject is not a genderless subject as it is often considered in the neoliberal model of personhood. The figure of the entrepreneur belonging to a certain generation of women has been gendered within the broader social and economic transformations of the post-Soviet space.

The two prevalent forms of mobility as a livelihood strategy are small-scale cross-border trade and labor migration. Bazaar traders travel far distances to purchase merchandise in supplier countries such as China, Turkey, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa. Labor migrants mostly commute between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Traders, just like workers depend on trans-border price differentials in goods and labor. For both groups the changing legal regulations of movement between countries are essential. Fieldwork in the space in and in-between Russia and Kyrgyzstan, following and interviewing mobile traders and laborers in a train and on the market, allowed me to uncover a multiplicity of pull and push factors for engaging in mobility as a livelihood strategy. Taking mobility regimes as an analytical lens reveals the salience of history, spatiality, gender, generation, and ethnicity as factors that are “placing” the actors in a particular opportunity grid. Scrutinizing the different regulatory levels of mobility regimes (international, local, personal) shows that ‘objective” constraints and individual strategies are mutually constitutive for the making, unmaking and remaking of these regimes. From this transtemporal and multi-level approach, I show how actors on the ground are struggling, challenging, and shaping the constantly transforming regulations on mobility, but also their intransigent limits.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1221k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Furthermore, this thesis reveals the effect of neighborhood on habitual dispositions of Tuzcu residents such as language incompetency, taste and gestures which are visible stigma signs of Tuzcu Roma.

Regarding stigmatization as the outcome of Tuzcu Roma habitus, I scrutinize impression management of Roma by drawing on Goffmanian passing and covering strategies. Passing through covering emerges as the main strategy both among socially mobile and immobile Tuzcu Roma. When they draw on only iterational elements of stigmatized habitual dispositions, strategies are not successful. On the other hand, effective passing strategies through covering stem from cleft habitus of Tuzcu Roma which make use of projective and practical-evaluative element of the agentic dimension.

Originally established in 1812, it flourished and evolved under both the Mughal Empire and the British colonial regime. Since 1962, the festival is being hosted by the civil society organization named Anjuman Sair-e-Gulfaroshan in collaboration with the government of Delhi. Hosted annually at the Hindu temple of Yogmaya Devi and the Islamic shrine of Bakhtiar Kaki in Mehrauli, one of the oldest neighborhoods of the capital, the festival seeks to promote social parity and communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims of the city. Influenced by the historic turn within anthropology, the analysis presented in the thesis shows that the festival should be viewed as a contentious and dynamic process that constantly shapes, and in turn is impacted by, the agency of its participants and the myriad urban spaces of Delhi where it is staged. Moreover, the thesis explores the manner in which the different polities that have ruled the city (Mughal Empire, British Raj and the postcolonial state in Delhi) have influenced and controlled the festival to serve their specific needs. In the process, it offers a critique of the existing academic literature on festivals and demonstrates that Phool Waalon Ki Sair has less to do with the promotion of inter-religious harmony and more with serving as both the site as well as the medium of the relations of power through which Delhi has been governed over the course of time. Thus, the thesis seeks to highlight that concepts like power, agency, and placemaking are essential to any anthropological study of festivals.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1514k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The law strategically excluded civil society organizations (CSOs) from five specific politically sensitive areas among which the promotion of the rights of disabled people is the one. The government’s intention was to keep away those influential international CSOs and local CSOs with more than 10 percent of their budget from foreign funding agencies, from engaging in the politics of the state. However, the unintended consequence victimized local disabled people’s organizations (DPOs). As a result, DPOs’ representation, as well as the participation of disabled people, seems to be at risk. Based on 26 semi-structured interviews and five-months ethnographic research, conducted among the blind community in three urban areas and one semi-rural village in Ethiopia, this thesis develops two main arguments. First, the participation and positionality (exclusion) of disabled people, particularly those who live in the urban areas, is not only implicitly (re)produced and shaped by the state and non-state actors but also consumed by the government to restore and maintain the hegemony of the state. Second, there is a significant gap between the socially-constructed and mainstream (theoretical) understanding of disability which guides the intervention, and the lived experiences (empirical) of disability. By analyzing these two main arguments, I conclude that the politics of the state and the fact that the socially constructed understanding of disability guides the disability intervention are the determinant factors of the marginalization of disabled people in Ethiopia.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (599k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

In my analysis, they emerge as part and parcel of the neoliberal turn in English politics. Thatcherâ€™s and the New Labour governments enabled student loans by embedding them into larger higher education marketisation processes. Justifications for student loans also utilize the notion of the student to create a common consent on the implementation of the loan system. I used thematic analysis informed by discourse analysis to analyse my data. My findings show that student loans were made possible by a reconceptualization of the aim of higher education as an economic asset for the state and the personal benefit for the student. Even though higher education is largely framed as a sector providing high economic gain for the state, the rationalities of student loans are largely focused on the benefits for the student. The conception of the student as the beneficiary, the investor and the customer are largely used to justify the necessity and the benefit of student loans.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (610k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The response to the call for the demonstration was overwhelming and launched an 18-day sit-in within Tahrir Square in Cairo, as well as other sit-ins and demonstrations throughout Egypt and solidarity demonstrations in front of Egyptian embassies abroad, ultimately leading to deposing the former president Muhammad Husni Mubarak in February 2011. Between February 2011 and August 2013, a lifetime’s worth of violent and polarizing clashes and confrontations took place. The end result of these clashes and confrontations is the reinstatement of a military-led authoritarian regime that is cracking down on individual and collective liberties, enforcing harsh austerity measures under the guise of neo-liberal reform, and an increased sense of embitterment concerning living in Egypt. Within the experience of the Revolution, I investigate ‘revolutionary purity’ as a simultaneously powerful and ambiguous force, born out of an Arabic tradition of linking ‘Revolution’ and ‘Purity’ that influenced the trajectory of the Revolution in Egypt. By bringing together the life stories of active participants in the Revolution and my autoethnography as a witness of the Revolution from a distance, I argue that revolutionary purity came into being between the personal and the political; the revolutionaries’ personal aspirations and frustrations, and their unfolding modes of politicization throughout the lifetime of the Revolution. I also claim that revolutionary purity didn’t exist solely within the realm of the Revolution and its time. Its inception can be traced back to the everyday lives of people before the Revolution, as well as today through the experiences of revolutionaries living through the despair of the defeat of the Revolution.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (484k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The crisis had resulted in the intensification of the migration discourse that was never seen before in the country. A part of this intensification was a strong state campaign that has been built on the crisis: a nationalist and hegemonic rhetoric which was rejective and hostile towards migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. This propaganda spoke about migratory processes in the framework of securitization where the process was understood and mobilized as a threat to the European-Christian culture. This narrative was not only rhetorically but visually outstanding. State financed posters and advertisements represented “the migrant” as a voiceless, faceless, male, violent, dark-skinned person who is not even an individual but exists in a horde-like group of people. Besides of this xenophobic and hostile context, counter-hegemonic narratives emerged not just in the form of social movements but, as I argue, in the artistic-visual field too. In my thesis, I focus on this contemporary counter-discourse of the Hungarian cinema through the lenses of three movies which have a privileged position in the “migration movie” corpus in Hungary, not only because all of them was funded by the state but because they earned nationwide recognition. These movies are The Citizen (2016), Jupiter’s Moon (2017) and Easy Lessons (2018). The first part of my research would like to contextualize these movies with special regard to their socio-political and cultural context. For this, I carry out discourse analysis on the already existing literature. After, I make the analysis of the movies themselves to explore the place of them in the discourse on visual representation and migration after 2015. The main questions of the analysis are how these movies are the part of the counter-discourse, what are those circumstances by the dominant state discourse that could challenge free artistic expression, and in which ways aesthetic and political elements are intertwined in the visual language of these movies. The research would like to answer these questions through the politics of (in)visibility and those artistic instruments that aim to transform the unseen “Other” into visible. Therefore the thesis displays two competing visual attitudes towards the representation of migration: one by the neo-authoritarian state propaganda and another by the contemporary Hungarian cinema.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (430k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

This direction is the industrial waste research have been blossoming since the Hungarian red mud accident. This thesis, explores the way in which recently emerged scientific labour and knowledge production develop potential technoscientific processes in order to reuse the bauxite residue, in public imagination better known as red mud. To recycle the red sludge in a diversified way, alumina industry players prefer to categorise it as by-product rather than industrial waste. What is at stake in the growing red mud research is the classification of the matter as by-products which allows companies to treat the bauxite residue as a marketable product rather than a potentially harmful waste. In this thesis, I offer an ontologically flat analysis which looks at the matter’s molecular interactions. By this, I show how unexpected entanglements of the red mud with other organic matters and living beings, such as water, soil microbes, earth worms and fishes, reveals myriad biochemical interactions which can be both deadly and beneficial for living-organisms in nature. However, as the red mud is also the repository of valuable components such as the rare earth element, such as scandium, it became locus of global competition between the EU and China. I argue that the case of the red mud demonstrates that recognising agency of microscopic elements in nature is twofold: it fosters a self-cleaning nature argument which might not think about latency in an invisible chemical infrastructure, and it contributes to further economic value extraction in global capitalist production under the disguise of zero-waste economy.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1012k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Feminist movements globally have altered traditional patriarchal mentalities and helped women negotiate for their social and political space in a male-dominated world. In simple words, what have feminist movements striven for, among other things? Equality. However, beginning from a historically specific (western) and ethnocentric understanding, feminist theories have evolved to appreciate nuances brought about by culture and history across geographical contexts. Nevertheless, despite the differences in culture, outlook, practices and rhetoric of different feminist movements, the core ideal of feminism, that of gender equality, remains at the epicenter across the world. Broadly speaking, despite the immense differences in different feminisms, and critiques of western feminism for being ethnocentric and ignorant of realities of non-western women, feminism has striven for agency, freedom and gender equality. Freedom and gender equality have broadly agreed upon definitions, but the word agency here means an individual’s potential to act, but only under a given set of cultural, social, political and religious boundaries. This concept will be critically elaborated upon, and discussed in extensive detail later. Keeping in mind the Marxist and postcolonial critiques of the so-called universalizing western feminism, this thesis is an appreciation of the universal value of feminist ideals and their expression through an insight into a postcolonial feminist movement ‘Aurat (women) March’ within a semi-theocratic Islamic republic, Pakistan. In addition to this argument, this thesis also argues for the creation of more theoretical space to understand feminism in a religious and socially conservative society since its practices, demands and outlook might be different from the western approach, but its aspirations are equally revolutionary and transformative. Eventually, this movement’s practices and ideas, are a source of rich theoretical insights. This research gathered data through online semi-structured qualitative interviews with the duration of 25-30 minutes each. Some of the interviews were bilingual (English and Urdu) that were later transcribed into English. The interviewees talked about their affiliations with the march and how they became a part of the march, how it helped them to claim their basic rights, to express them themselves in a male dominated space', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1241k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Studies emphasize women’s institutional distrust and anxiety towards state maternity hospitals. In the discussions of women’s resistance to the systematic medical mistreatment, the notion of women’s agency is usually reduced to intentionality and individual decision-making, while the less is said about the relational dimension of agency and responsibilities for decisions made. In the present research, I fill this gap by addressing the case of childbirth with doulas in Moscow hospitals. Unlike midwives, doulas do not perform any medical manipulations, but provide women with informational, emotional, and physical support before, during, and after delivery. Drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews with women who experienced childbirth with doulas in Moscow maternity hospitals and at home, I examine how women’s agency and embodiment are mediated by doulas’ professional support. I introduce the notion of the guided labour to illustrate the role of a doula in childbirth, in which she functions as a guide, a translator, and an advocate. The doulas’ support and expertise help women gain a stronger “voice” in the Russian maternity care system. By deploying the phenomenological approach of the lived body, this research goes beyond the study of various discourses of “a good birth” and “a good mother” and explores how they are reinterpreted by women themselves and enacted by women’s bodies. I argue that despite the rise of neoliberal parenting culture and commercialization of care in post-Soviet Russia, mothers-to-be are experienced double-burden of responsibility: one comes from the intensive motherhood ideology and the other – from the Russian pronatalist politics.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (517k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

For women with higher education and more advantageous social relations and who became employed in the program due to their caring responsibilities which were hard to reconcile with wage-work, public work was rather a safety net by providing informal help such as being a flexible workplace which contributed to fulfill care work until they could find jobs in the labour market which they were satisfied with.

Firstly, I analyse how the value chains span into the network through re-outsourcing of work between freelancers and enable value capture for individual freelancers. Those who outsource act as suppliers in the value chains and depend on trust relations with their subcontractors, while those subcontractors who are in weak structural positions both on the platform and domestic labour market depend on them for access to jobs and platform reputation. Secondly, I show how the network is utilized for learning, as well as social and emotional support. As freelancers act as fragmented suppliers of which majority is in extremely precarious positions and acts mostly as a labour reserve army, these processes are needed for their further engagement in the market. Furthermore, due to structural constraints, this network lacks capacities for political organization and it serves primarily individuals to compete within these value chains. Thus, the processes of value creation and capture, learning and cooperation, as well as relational work, which are regularly integrated into firm value chains, are in the case of platform outsourcing dispersed and decentralized throughout the freelance networks constructed from the bottom-up.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1015k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

I analyze the development of the grassroots activist network in the district, unusual for Hungary, and the electoral campaign that led to the conquest of the municipality. In dialogue with the literature on urban neoliberalism and its alternatives - with a particular attention to grassroots urban movements emerging in CEE after 2008 – I consider the opportunities and challenges of this emerging new urban politics in Budapest. In doing so, I focus on the process in which an emancipatory politics came to confront authoritarian neoliberal governance.

I ask beyond the neoliberal regulations that the government imposes on the privatized education, how the embedded neoliberal rationality in the institutional and individual levels is operating from below. I specifically look into the bilateral relationships between supply and demand sides of the choice system of education provision to explore the diverse tendencies involved in it, including neoliberalism, Islamic technocracy, and class middle-class, whose advantages highly depend on the formation of a coalition. The thesis is based on research conducted in Tehran, from late September 2019 until early December 2019, consisted of 27 interviews with parents, school principals, and other school staff. Further, it is supplemented by non-participant observation in two female private high schools. Drawing on three months’ fieldwork, I explain the complexity of the school choice process from both sides of the deal; education provider and education consumer. On the one hand, I argue that how the school management board narrows down the composition of staff and students to maintain and present the school’s distinctive institutional habitus. On the other hand, I describe the parental school choice, which operates as a class strategy safeguarding the privileged social positions and possessed capital of the family while ensuring the prospect attainment of the student, academically and professionally. Thus, this thesis sheds new light on the relational networks involved in the choice system of education provision that considerably contribute to the perpetuation and reproduction of social inequality.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (561k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Aikune is a rehabilitation gymnastics for treatment and prevention of the spine and musculoskeletal system diseases.

Going through an aikune session, people work on the spinal muscles and deal with specific body experience and pain that comes along with rehabilitation process. Both these experience and knowledge about physiology that they gain in the process of learning aikune change their relationships with their bodies, their perception of health and the role of pain in the process of rehabilitation and health care practices.In my research, I focus on the question of agency in a way people approach their health care in terms of treating and preventing diseases. Analyzing interview materials and my own experience in aikune community, I showcase the ways how self-healing skills and physiological knowledge change people’s health care strategies in their everyday lives and what changes this knowledge brings to people’s agency in a wide social context of contemporary Russia. The experience of rehabilitation teaches people to distinguish the recovery pain from the disease pain, perceiving pain in general as a language of communication with their bodies through the nervous system. According to this understanding of pain, they stop curing pain as a symptom, but they treat the problem instead. With the knowledge of self-healing, aikune center’s patients gain certain control over their bodies that lets them reduce the need for medical help. Physiological knowledge they receive during aikune sessions also helps people to restructure their habits and everyday lives in a way to maintain their health.

To support the latter, the Korean government developed a temporary labor migration scheme to invite foreign workers. Simultaneously, it offered a visa to the Korean diaspora in China and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in recognition of their ethnic kinship, allowing them to find employment in low-skilled jobs. Ethnic Koreans from CIS who, unlike Koreans from China, do not speak the Korean language occupy the lowest position in the hierarchy of foreign workers in the labor market. Their lives in the ethnic homeland are precarious, filled with unpredictability and insecurity. This thesis aims to add ethnographic findings to the existing literature on the reproduction of precarity and the ways it sneaks into the interactions between different groups of people affected by it in various ways. By analyzing Korean temporary labor migration schemes, statistical data, and existing literature on precarity, I argue that the variegated visa system for ethnic Koreans in China and CIS is aimed at the reproduction of a precarious class made of ethnic kin to fill the low-skilled labor market.

Based on ethnographic engagement with a group of exiled Egyptian political activists who chose Berlin as their destination, I analyze their subjectivity formation and social becoming in exile. Through ethnographic findings, each chapter discusses one dimension of the complex process of becoming an exile. My main argument is two-fold: firstly, I argue that the socio-political phenomenon of exile is at the heart of Egyptian post-2013 politics and Egyptâ€™s counter-revolutionary aftermath. The exiles, who are the families and friends of the political prisoners in Egypt and the revolutionaries of the 2011 uprising are inseparable to the emergence of the post-2013 military-backed regime. Thus, studying the causes of the exiles closely is a way of articulating types of marginalization in contemporary Egypt. Secondly, the exiles are dysphoric subjects, who are shattered between the realities of exile, and their lived pasts and longing for return. I attempt to understand how the exiles feel their losses and experience their (suspended) relations with Egypt in exile. I focus on their emotions, dreams and narratives of their time in exile, to argue that the exiles are dysphoric subjects who are in a state of unease, uncertainty and in-betweenness due to their multiple losses. The dysphoric subjectivity I show is a painful process of becoming an exile. The exiles try to enliven and emplace the conditions of exile. As they are in transition, dysphoric subjects are also in dynamic, changing states of self-discovery and becoming. I contend that marginality, exile, could be a way of shaping types of political subjectivities that go beyond the national boundaries.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1052k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Restricted access for 3 years', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The problem of public surveillance became particularly relevant in Moscow in previous years, when Mayor Sergey Sobyanin introduced the launch of �Safe City� program. Surveillance technologies, assumed in this program, were claimed to be used for counter-terrorism purposes and the detection of wanted criminals. After political protests in summer 2020, the usage of CCTV with facial recognition system was criticized for violating human rights and invasion to personal privacy of citizens. Although facial recognition was introduced in Moscow not a long time ago, it raised the problem of digital rights. CCTV technologies have invoked the discussion about limits of surveillance. The purpose of my research is to find out how citizens’ perception of security measures and threat in urban environment correspond with the state agenda. Security is considered as a socially constructed category, and I analyze it from works of Copenhagen school of securitization and Paris school, which move the focus of security from international relations to sociology. Following Savitch’s assumptions of security’s reterritorialization tendencies and Harvey’s concept of �right to the city�, citizens are seen as political actors in urban space, who should feel the effect of public surveillance. For the research data, I collected answers of Moscow citizens about their perception of security measures in different public places. They also shared their opinions on security situation in Moscow and suggested possible justifications of its installation. I also analyzed media publications from databases and conducted expert interviews with lawyers specialized on human rights in digital sphere. My findings demonstrated that in Russian society the trust in rational and moderate use of surveillance technologies in future exists simultaneously with low credibility to police’s actions. While citizens showed awareness on abuse of power connected with facial recognition technologies, they don’t feel certain danger for themselves even while staying suspicious to them. The perception of urban threat has moved from terrorism and serious crimes to the danger that comes from other citizens. The results also uncovered the problem of understanding privacy as a concept belonged to human rights. Facial recognition lead to emergence of discussion about privacy in Russian society.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1306k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Methodologically, answers are derived through life-story interviews and autoethnography. Interviewees discussed stigma in relation to educational attainment, personal relationships and employment. Interviewees’ answers were mainly interpreted through the prism of Goffman’s and Link and Phelan’s theory of stigma, while the analysis was also informed by Parsons’ ‘sick role’, Foucault’s notion of ‘docile body’, Rose’s view of neoliberal entrepreneurial subjects, Hughson’s theory of gender roles in Serbia and Shih’s models of resistance to stigma. The thesis ultimately attempts to outline the mechanisms interviewees used in resisting stigma since the moment of their diagnoses until present day.

It examines the formal structures and informal arrangements practiced at the workplace, and the ways they shape and accommodate employees’ experiences; it inquires into the employees’ attitudes toward the job, their, largely value-oriented, goals as well as the caring relationships some of them develop toward the art collections and the institutional buildings; it specifically focuses on the tension, which, as argued, is essential to understanding the employees’ experiences of the job. This tension occurs between the employees’ dominant interest in the rewards other than money and their (sometimes critical) lack of economic capital. By inquiring into the respective sides of the tension, the research identifies the employees’ socioeconomic conditions and gender roles as the two main premises of the illusion of their economic disinterestedness and of their ability to “afford” to work at the institutions in the first place. By doing that, the thesis contributes to the scarce body of social research in the field of arts and culture in Ukraine. In particular, being based on participant observation and in-depth interviews, the research addresses the absence of ethnographic studies on working conditions in public cultural institutions and their professional employees.

I argue that the Nassar Sentencing Hearing can be expressed by Victor Turner’s account of “Social Drama,” which consists of four stages: breach, crisis, redressive action, and resolution. In this drama, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina plays the role of the “star-grouper” who Turner describes as the protagonist who pursues mechanisms of redress. Through an analysis of YouTube video recordings of the sentencing hearing from Law and Crime Network, I argue that Judge Aquilina plays four “roles” in the courtroom: a therapeutic figure, a victim advocate/activist, impartial Lady Justice, and retributive Lady Justice. By drawing on Role Theory, Bourdieu’s “Force of Law,” and Feminist Legal Theory, I dissect why Aquilina’s performance was generally viewed as a success in the eyes of the American public, but criticized by many in the field she represented, the field of law. Following Turner’s argument that rituals of social drama simultaneously draw from pre-existing cultural scripts and create new scripts, I argue that Aquilina (mostly) works within the bounds of the law while also promoting a feminist critique of judicial norms through her own example.

However, studies in history and philosophy bring key reasons for developing an explicitly sociological treatment of the concept. This thesis provides an argument for the social production of curiosity. On the strength of its motivating characteristic, the essay reformulates curiosity as an epistemic drive in society which organizes the social production of knowledge under given socio-historical and local-cultural circumstances. In the first part of the thesis, historical, philosophical, and sociological literature is reviewed to address common preconceptions of curiosity and give a context for the argument. Then a theoretical apparatus is developed considering the emergence, development, and impact of epistemic drives which serves as a foundation for a new perspective on what motivates the social production of knowledge. The second part of the thesis focuses on the empirical applicability of the epistemic drive notion of curiosity. As a case study, the problem of economic incentives in scientific research is considered. After presenting data on global climate change investments and U.S. federal research funding, the proposition is formed that economic incentives put research projects with short-term profitability at a significant advantage in acquiring funding compared to projects with little to none immediate economic return. A tendency which systematically mobilizes production-oriented epistemic drives and immobilizes risk-oriented ones. The idea of pure curiosity driven research is addressed by reporting on a recent science-industry conference at an Austrian basic research institution. It is concluded that even basic research is influenced by economic incentives that produce production-oriented epistemic drives. Through theoretical and empirical developments, the thesis suggests the usefulness of the epistemic drive notion in understanding the motivation and organization of knowledge production in society.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (574k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The research draws on 30 in-depth interviews with students and parents of Chinese elite families and participant observations at an elite education agency that provides personalised services to support their goals of elite education overseas. The families’ narratives and the agency’s mission demonstrate that elite international education goes beyond class-based consumption that facilitates the conversion of economic, cultural and social capital. It also means social reproduction and capital accumulation among elite families in contemporary China. Furthermore, the findings also suggest that the ultimate goals of education migration among the elites in China is not settlement overseas but to become global elites who enjoy home-field advantages in China while expanding their networks and resources across the world.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (925k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

It looks into the social movement that emerged around rave culture in Tbilisi and relates it to the global process of Europeanization of the country. By examining the portrayal of this movement on international media and putting it into conversation with the local actors – ravers and leaders of the movement, the paper argues that the movement was mobilized by intentional framing of technologies of rave culture, namely, cultural style, music, drugs, dance, and club space, as political. The political agency of ravers emerged in relation to the inhumane drug policy that the Georgian state was actively using as a repressive mechanism at that time. Apart from the collective political mobilization, this thesis investigates individual and performative ways of doing cultural politics. The sexuality and body politics, that largely marked the movement and the culture as queer, defined political agency of ravers in confrontation to the society. This very struggle between the younger and older generations, so-called liberal and conservative parts of society over the “right to the body” has largely been articulated by international media. While these framings are not necessarily wrong, they have omitted and downplayed the importance of the collective struggle against the police state and reduced the agenda of the movement to cultural confrontation between different groups of society. This process has taken place in the global context of what is labeled as “post-Soviet” transformation of the country from “pre-European” to the European state. On the conceptual level, the construction of modern liberal subjectivity has been exclusively defined in lines with queer modernity and serving to uphold developmentalist vision of Georgia by Western media. While embracing modernity as a reference point, rave culture in Georgia has negotiated and contested the Eurocentric vision of the culture through its struggle for the drug policy. Despite this contestation on the practice and discourse level, the movement has been largely dependent on international media representation. Whilst confined to one case, the study informs how culture that has mostly been associated with escapism and hedonism can produce political activism. It can further be expanded into covering the wider geopolitical space of post-Socialism as well as in theorizing Europeanization and ideas of modernity beyond cultural politics.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (611k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Adding to the literature of governmentality studies, it first analyzes how this EU financed infrastructure project contributes to the micro-politics of attracting foreign capital investments to industrial parks in postsocialist Hungary. Zoning is understood here as the cultural process of parceling space in specific manners, creating moral topologies which organize movements in a desired way. Connecting this setting to the transit zones at the Hungarian-Serbian border, the present taxonomy of movement in the Danube basin becomes clear: While in the case of capital investments space is deployed for the establishment relations, in the case of migration it is oppositely deployed to prevent it. By tracing this nexus back historically while staying situated in the Danube basin the second form of zoning is proposed following the conception of “critical zones”. Through this situated methodology, the contingency of the present zoning of Europe becomes apparent: While in the present, migration is stopped between Hungary and Serbia, the very same habitat appears as a central destination for migration from German lands after the Habsburgs defeat of the Ottomans at the end of the 17th century. Enlarging the empirical basis of governmentality studies towards the emergence of Cameralism, it becomes clear that this historic migration movement was also already organized through the technology of zoning: It was meant to cultivate life in the Danube basin in the form of a “civil society” as part of the emerging political discourse of Europe. In going beyond this analysis of zoning, it is asked whether the Danube as fundamentally relational socio-ecology might inspire new forms of solidarity beyond these translations of the discourse of Europe to the river’s basin.', 'Note': 'Degree: MA', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1499k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Based on low wages and low taxes, the country’s political economy mitigates against the emergence of а ‘broad middle’ habitually associated with the developed welfare states of the West. 80% of the working population ekes out less than 500 EUR monthly, making Bulgaria the poorest EU-member state. After three decades of neoliberal reforms, the country’s class structure resembles that of a Third world country: a tiny opulent minority sits atop a vast ocean of poverty. The unpopularity of this mode of economic development prompted the liberal ideologues of the Transition to create a social base for the liberal reforms in the early 2000s, a project that culminated with the 2013 anti-corruption protests. Therefore, I analyze the insurgent “middle class” as a political, rather than economic formation. More specifically, I explore the formation of the Bulgarian middle class from the vantage point of the 2013 summer protests. That year saw feverish protest mobilizations in two phases in winter and summer. Even though these protests occupy determinate temporal frames, their significance reverberates to this day because commentators continue to make sense of current events through the prism of the “long 2013.”  Time and again pundits and participants stated that the summer protests portended the birth of the middle class. I follow these discussions in the public sphere and tease out the vectors of inclusion into the self-identified middle class.  The first part of the thesis focuses on class formation and class consciousness where class is understood in materialist yet non-economistic terms. I offer a way of thinking about the problem of the ‘middle class’ that breaks with the double objectivism of structural and mechanical theories extrapolating its existence from the laws of capital in Orthodox Marxism, on the one hand, and from liberal stratification theories which rely on arbitrary income brackets to discern its existence, on the other. Because of the strong emphasis on class polarization, inherited from the Manifesto, the ‘middle class’ has traditionally posed a challenge Marxists have tended to overcome via a recourse to Weberian ‘prosthetics’.  In contrast, I treat class as a political becoming, every class is always-already a “class against”. Thus, a ‘subjectivist’ approach to social class is well suited to understand this formation. To this end, I fashion a theoretical apparatus out of Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology and the Essex School’s Discourse Theory to account for the discursive and polemical constitution of the middle class of the 2013 summer protests. This theoretical amalgam offers a polemical slant to theorizing class formation, resonating with some early remarks on the political nature of social class by Karl Marx.  I do so against the backdrop of the thorny path of the neoliberal reform in Bulgaria. I argue that the middle class is the crystallization of a long search on part of policy elites, civil society practitioners and democratization experts to find the “social base” for the neoliberal reform, perceived as increasingly beleaguered by populism, left and right.  One such challenge to the reform consensus came in the wake of the winter protest of 2013. It rebelled against austerity, poverty and the political establishment, yet it did so by poaching the liberal semantic field and appropriating the language of “civil society”. The summer protests re-appropriated the appropriation and, in the process, subjectivized itself as “middle class” against the winter protests and the corrupt oligarchic elite.  The second part of the thesis traces the effects the 2013 class imaginaries exert on the formal and universalistic political equality under liberalism. The discourse of “the middle class” organized the protesters’ normative visions about citizenship and national identity along increasingly inegalitarian, demophobic and elitist lines.  This dissertation thus follows an instance of ‘class struggle’ unfolding on the terrains of civil society, citizenship and nationhood. I show how the radicalization of imaginaries about class difference are projected onto the political field resulting in a tendency to question formal equality under liberalism.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (4468k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

It is based on a ten-month fieldwork that took place between December 2014 and July 2017 in three Belarusian cities. Analyzing my informants’ life-stories and the unions’ organizational trajectories through a set of critical junctions within the Belarusian state-capital-labor nexus, I trace the class genesis of Belarusian populism through the lens of Gramsci’s notion of the passive revolution. This analysis shows that the Belarusian working class, rather than passively suffering under post-Soviet capitalist accumulation, co-determined the political trajectory of post-soviet capitalism through populist mobilizations in the early 1990s, contributing to a passive-revolutionary process of gradual marketization that I characterize as neo-perestroika. Labor’s structural strength in wresting economic concessions, however, dialectically coincided with the delegation of the political direction to a Caesarist leader who appropriated labor’s populist energy. Thus, in Belarus’ type of populism, paternalism is complemented by an expansion of quasi-feudal control over labor, as revealed in the cooptation and marginalization of trade unions on the one hand, and in the bureaucratic work flexibilization combined with what I call labor immobilization on the other.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2095k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

New ideas and practices of observing, analyzing, and intervening in the social realities of socialist society emerged beginning in the early 1960s, originally in debates over the canonical disciplines of Marxist-Leninist social science (historical materialism, scientific socialism, and Marxist sociology). These were further developed by Marxist revisionist and humanist Marxist thought on the relationship between individuals and society in socialism, which decentered the collectivist ethos characteristic of “dogmatic” Marxism-Leninist philosophy for most of the 1950s. Made possible by the Marxist humanist breakthrough of the early 1960s, Marxist-Leninist sociology was subsequently established as a separate discipline at the Academy of Social and Political Sciences and at the University of Bucharest. Institutional and intellectual constraints and possibilities were differently configured in these two contexts. For the case of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences, the dissertation emphasizes the dynamic between local, transnational, and global frameworks of knowledge production, and the role of Eastern bloc cooperation in the field of sociology in particular. In the Romanian context, the interplay between local and transnational frames of reference resulted in studies of the social structure of socialist society that sought to rework concepts of everyday Marxism-Leninism—as formulated in party pronouncements and translated into the planning of knowledge production in the social sciences. The most notable among these was the concept of “social homogenization.” Developed since the second half of the 1960s, through to the qualitative turn of the late 1970s, and into the 1980s, its history illustrates the interplay between legitimization and criticism characteristic of Marxist-Leninist sociology.  Several student cohorts were trained at the University of Bucharest between 1965, when the sociology department was first established, through to 1977, when the department was disbanded, and in a very restricted sense until the end of the 1980s. As taught at the university, sociology drew on Marxist, interwar, and Western sociological sources. This idiosyncratic intellectual blend underpinned large-scale empirical research on the two main sociological issues of social development (especially in relation to industrialization and urbanization) and scientific management (in relation to social planning). By outlining the context of sociology as practiced at the university alongside oral history accounts by sociology students trained at the time, generational, intellectual, and existential fault lines come to the fore beneath a commonly shared understanding of sociology as an apolitical science of “social engineering” with roots in the interwar period.  The second part of the dissertation proposes a “reverse genealogy” of three themes which became part of the imaginary of postsocialist intellectual thought on the social: participation, equality, and welfare. It explores how the three intellectual, institutional, and generational contexts identified in the first part of the dissertation played out in sociological research on mass culture, women’s emancipation, and the quality of life in the 1960s–80s.', 'System Det': 'Degree: PhD'}"

It follows two cases of collective mobilization around martyr figures â€“ the cult of the Russian soldier Evgenii Rodionov beheaded in Chechen captivity in 1996, and two Greek Cypriot protesters, Anastassios Isaak and Solomos Solomou, killed as a result of clashes between Greek and Turkish Cypriot protesters during a 1996 anti-occupation rally. Two decades after the tragic incidents, memorial events organized for Rodionov and Isaak and Solomou continue to attract thousands of people and only seem to grow in scale, turning their cults into a platform for the production and dissemination of competing visions of morality and social order. This dissertation shows how martyr figures are mobilized in Russia and Cyprus to articulate a conservative moral project built around nationalism, militarized patriotism, and Orthodox spirituality. It argues that the public appetite for the radical model of self-sacrifice embodied in these new martyr cults developed in response to the social anomie and perceived erasure of traditional values that bind communities together in the wake of the rapidly changing economic and political organization of everyday life. The contribution of this dissertation is two-fold. First, through a transnational ethnography of martyr veneration, it reveals the formative role the notion of self-sacrifice plays in shaping nationalist and political imaginaries in contemporary nation-states. It develops a typology of communal ethical responses to the figures of victims, martyrs, and heroes and outlines the distinct forms of commemoration they engender. Second, it offers an in-depth account of the heterogeneous Russian and Greek Cypriot nationalist-conservative movements and reconstructs the moral visions at the root of their mobilizations. It demonstrates that the popular appeal of moral conservatism, while not unrelated to economic ills and hostility towards ethnic Others, cannot be entirely reduced to either of these factors. Rather, it represents a collective attempt to imagine a new moral community grounded in religious transcendence and reconstruct a public culture marked by passion, emotionally charged symbols, and militaristic vigor.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (5527k)'}"

Migrant workers service cities that never sleep, and remain largely unseen to the dominant, diurnal gaze. By and large glocturnal city’s ‘other workers’ act according to the 24/7 demand-clock at the expense of the dysfunctionalities created to their circadian rhythms of night-sleep, day-awake/rest. Based on the analysis of the relationship between three factors, the dissertation explores the destructive creation of bio-automaton labour force sustaining the night-time economy. The structural factors analysed are the intensification of labour, time alterations and the glocturnal city as locality that offers the night-time space as the continuation for day structure, the labour force, and also its strategic position in wealth production. Night shift work depletes the workers’ bodily resources. The workers’ bodies’ physical supply translates into stamina to withstand the strenuous night work, overall duress and sleeplessness. This dissertation investigates to what extent permanent night shift workers manage bodily precariousness, as an essential aspect of human condition subordinated to the post-circadian capitalist climate. Enacting migrants’ lives by doing night shifts at the Spitalfields fruit and vegetable market, and drawing on 12 months of close participant observation amongst loaders, servers and forklift drivers, an ethnographer puts considerable strain on her/his daily life. The dissertation addresses the difficulties and practical aspects of enacted ethnography to observe the less-visible forms of cooperation in the workplace.  Migrant night shift workers do something together but not with one another. Night shift workers survive precariousness because they are immune to coworkers’ needs, and not because they offer each other mutual support out of humanness. Through the analytical lens of learned bodily knowledge, the dissertation interrogates the modes of the embodiment that over time enhance night workers’ social life skills. The becoming of embodied cooperation not only involves routinised, rhythmic practices ingrained in the body through repetitive, physical tasks, but also physical gestures that build friendly social relations amongst workers who learn to engage meaningfully in dealing with ambiguity, resistance and difference. The relevant aspects of embodied forms of interaction investigated involve workers’ trajectories being disrupted from naturally cooperative to socially competitive.  Post-circadian capitalist era disrupts capabilities for sociality. In other words, contemporary capitalism turns cooperative people into competitors through organised forms of labour that limit workers’ economic rights. The dissertation not only contributes to our understanding of the structural mechanisms that involve competition and systematically weaken cooperation between workers but also advances the idea that social encounters are predicated on systematic learning and practising of bodily cooperation. Thus, it extends practice theory and migration studies on knowledge constructed and accumulated through labour that migrants apply to the conduct of everyday life in global cities. Last, engaging these works in conversation with social anthropologists to explain work-based embodied knowledge, in effect the thesis offers an innovative method for social inquiries to capture the glocturnal cities’ strategic power generating the drive for economic expansion beyond the night frontier that functions 24/7 on the backdrop of the bodily precariousness of workers.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (306k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The millennium’s real estate crisis made its appearance at diverse segments of the cities across the world, touching housing, office buildings, retail spaces, community venues and public buildings, and strongly affected municipal and national budgets as well as welfare services. While in many countries, the economic crisis culminated in a devastating foreclosure crisis, the corresponding escalation of non-residential property vacancy created possibilities in many European cities for an alternative model of user-generated, community-led urban development processes through the adaptive reuse of empty buildings, spaces or land. In cities where a strong alliance of various actors created the right conditions and assurances, long-lasting structures and opportunities were created.�In others, user-generated regeneration projects were instrumentalised and incorporated in institutional or for-profit development processes. Yet in others, in the absence of credible public actors, the non-profit private and civic sectors became guardians of public values, functions and services. While there has been significant research conducted into the housing crisis (Madden and Marcuse 2016), lending procedures (Fujita 2013), gentrification processes (Lees et al 2010) and foreclosures (Bergdoll and Martin 2012), other foundational institutions of urban life like civic spaces –�accessible and affordable community and work spaces produced by squatters, architects, artist collectives or NGOs – have been largely neglected by this research. Most accounts of civic spaces represent particular viewpoints, present best or worst practices and ignore the broader social, legal, professional and discursive context in which these initiatives are rooted. Furthermore, limited to investigating single city cases, much of the existing research fails to recognise the different variations of multi-stakeholder cooperation and the ways these models are transferred between cities and replicated,adopted or fail to be adjusted to local circumstances. By bringing together resources from urban studies, sociology, planning, policy and architecture as well as my professional and activist work, original action research and footage consisting of over 50 interviews, event documentations and reports, this research aims at bridging this gap. Looking into the processes in which non-institutional actors, inspired by the opportunities offered by abandoned spaces, enter the urban planning, design and development field, and learn how to work with vacant buildings, regulations, restoration procedures, finance and management, this dissertation explores actor networks that have emerged in the past years in four urban regions that reflect the diversity of cooperation frameworks between citizen initiatives, public administrations and the private sector. While Budapest has rigid institutions and isolated civic initiatives, Rome witnesses the unfolding of a parallel welfare infrastructure confronting the public administration, the Dutch cities have created consensual structures to accommodate citizen innovation, and in Berlin, civic spaces established forms of complete autonomy through accessing the ownership of formerly empty buildings. Juxtaposing these networks in a comparative analysis with the help of the actor-network theory (Latour 2005), the following chapters investigate the cooperations and conflicts that emerge around discourses, interventions, mechanisms and policies related to the reuse of vacant spaces. Addressing the growing debate about the role of public, private and civic actors in the governance of public assets, the dissertation forms the theses that the latitudes of civic initiatives are defined by actor networks that are deeply embedded in social tissues and structures of cooperation and that civic innovation in urban development almost always relies on public resources and facilitating structures, but forming a critical mass, citizen initiatives can bypass existing frameworks and rewrite the rules of cooperation.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (2232k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

I substantiate this argument across three sections. I coin the concept of moving labor power, which is theoretically conceived in a manner that enables it to explore the moments that take place between the turning of body power into labor power (social reproduction) and the transformation of labor power into labor (production). The first section explores the agreements signed between Bulgaria and Vietnam in the period between 1973 and 1989 negotiating the exchange of labor between the two countries. The migratory category under scrutiny in this section is the internationalist socialist worker (ISW). The section proposes that state socialism framed moving labor power as a complementary and non-antagonistic relation between production and reproduction. I argue that the transition from state socialism to liberal democracy in Bulgaria brought about a situation where the relation between moving labor power, reproduction and production engendered a clear contradiction. Section two deals with the social benefit tourist (SBT): a category whose discursive formation aims at disciplining workers into laboring (production), forgoing any expectations of social welfare provision (social reproduction). SBT is free to move. Capital accumulation and freedom of movement connect in such a way that labor power depends on freed movement in order to be able to reproduce itself. In this configuration, we witness the creation of a specific type of moving labor power that must travel wide and far in order to ensure the maintenance of its body power. Section three delves into the ideological formation of the differentiation between true refugees and economic migrants. I argue that this differentiation belongs to economic liberalism, which disembeds the “economic” from the “political” by detaching coercion from processes of production, distribution and allocation, and which makes “the economy” appear free from violence. The section traces the effects of this ideological presupposition through an analysis of border crossing and detention centers. I show how these effects slow down and tame the movement of labor power into labor markets. The arguments in this dissertation are anchored in the premise that we need to exceed the legal frameworks of migration that are readily available to us and interrogate the very spaces (historical, ideological, and socio-political) of their making in order to understand the relation between capitalism and migration.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3953k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The dissertation is based on 18 months of fieldwork and an extensive analysis of various historical documents of the post-89 era. While firmly grounded in the sociological, anthropological, and political economic literatures on class and industrial labor in post-89 Central and Eastern Europe, it recasts some of the major questions of this broad field of study and, with the benefit of both depth and hindsight, offers more nuanced answers and interpretations. Against various capital-logic or victimhood accounts of labor in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989, the dissertation uncovers a complex, multifaceted and convoluted hidden history of industrial work and workers—one out of many possible. Both individual laborers and organized labor hence appear as active makers of their own history, albeit never quite to the extent and in the manner they pleased. More specifically, they appear as initiators, supporters, or adversaries of a series of hegemonic projects meant to anticipate, foster, or respond to an ever-changing political economy, with the ostensible goal of affirming and establishing the material and symbolic value of industrial labor despite the hostility and ill omens of the times. Regardless of the setting of these hegemonic struggles—inside the factory, in the labor market, or in the neighborhood—ambiguities, contradictions, and dead ends abounded, resulting from endless frictions between misaligned political and moral economies of industrial labor. Based on a highly selective, primarily export-driven reindustrialization of the former state socialist countries of CEE, the maturing of dependent development in the 2000s fostered uneven development and labor fragmentation to an unprecedented extent. It thus offered a genuine possibility of success in asserting the value of labor, although only at the cost of hegemonic projects embracing and struggling for, not against, inequality and exclusion. If the cultivation of exclusionary solidarity eventually proved a recipe for success in mounting an organized offensive against capital, in rising to the apex of the labor market, and in achieving an ideal of urban modernity thought long lost, it also engendered increasingly obvious vulnerabilities and potential for failure. On the side of both the included and the excluded, exclusionary solidarity has resulted in deep personal anxieties, apparently insurmountable problems of social reproduction, and diminishing capacity of collective struggle.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (26059k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

Nowadays, it is portrayed as the necessary philosophy of socio-economic life, seemingly driving both companies and cities, to engage in an all-out competitive struggle for resources. However, competition between cities is neither ‘natural’ nor a ‘macroeconomic condition’ of contemporary urbanism but a dynamic and relational ensemble of socio-spatial policy processes that connect and disconnect cities, scales and wider policy networks. For European cities, the engineering of inter-urban competition is a state-led political and economic project: it is not a coherent project of the EU but a partial assemblage of different policy processes that have uneven consequences, and that are contestable and contested. Yet, instead of looking at inter-urban competition and competitive bidding solely as phenomena that are reflecting and reinforcing class interests, state projects or hegemonic ideologies, it is more productive to focus on how these processes of inter-city rivalries are actually unfolding and on the specific labor practices that make them possible. Elite and state projects need to be labored-over. In this dissertation, I propose a relational and processual approach to the study of inter-urban competition based on the one hand, on the relationality of places and scales, and on the other hand, on the relationality of expertise and the interplay between competitive, cooperative and conflictual social relations underlying enactments of expertise. While drawing on a multi-sited research of the Spanish competition for the European Capital of Culture 2016 title, I focus on the enactments of expertise and the techno-political work that inter-city rivalries require, and their contradictory effects. During this research, I carried out an extensive examination of policy documents and 110 in-depth interviews with policy actors involved in the competitive bidding process (civil servants, local professionals, external experts, technocrats, politicians, corporate actors, cultural producers, activists, and volunteers). I argue that processes of inter-urban competition are made possible through three labor practices: first, the imagineering of the city through comparative practices with competitors, model and reference cities, second, emotional labor and the management of optimism, hope, and civic pride, and third, the instrumentalization of ‘extra-economic’ aspects in the pursuit of competitiveness. As part of the enactments of expertise, imaginative labor (through relational comparisons and the instrumentalization of the extra-economic) is prioritized and considered more ‘worthy’, while emotional labor is seen as ‘inferior’ work performed by street-level civil servants or policy actors in lower hierarchical positions – usually by women. Processes of competition and the pursuit of competitiveness are both premised on and reinforcing this privileging of imaginative over emotional labor. Competition itself is an inherently unbalanced, divisive, and ungovernable process. Inter-city rivalries are messy, antagonistic and cruel for the policy actors that are laboring for them. It leads to conflict, competition, and contradictions, and a weakening of cooperative social relations in and between cities, scales and wider policy networks. Yet, there are also openings and cracks in processes of competitive bidding, as actors – that are positioned in the flux of the increasing valorization and instrumentalization of the ‘extra-economic’ – encounter discrepancies that enable them to practice critical politics.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (3291k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

The particular issue explored to achieve this goal is the striking improvement in healthcare provision in Hakkâri, a small Kurdish province in the southeastern corner of Turkey, between 2002 and 2013 and the unforeseen effects of this improvement. This thesis reveals that the on-going improvement in healthcare provision in Hakkâri is part of a nationalist strategy implemented in the whole of the Kurdish region by the conservative AK Party. This is a strategy committed to defending the unity of the nation against the ethno-political claims of the Kurdish movement. This strategy diverged from the usual Turkish stance towards Kurds even if it still maintained the usual “one nation” narrative. Compared to the violent policies and inadequacy of social services in the pre-AK Party period, the general Kurdish policy of the Turkish state between 2002 and 2013 was less violent, more inclined to recognize some Kurdish claims, and, most importantly, relied on the effective use of social policy instruments, as can be followed in the statistics concerning public investment and social assistance. This thesis asks why this strategy, the “politics of service”, evidently failed to liquidate the Kurdish movement. How is it possible that the Kurdish movement has reached the peak of its power in a period characterized by less violent and more benevolent policies? The answer is given through a detailed analysis of an everyday form of ethno-political resistance in Hakkâri. Even though Hakkârians have been able to access a more or less adequate health service in Hakkâri thanks to the policies and investment introduced after 2002, patient dissatisfaction in Hakkâri still persists as a mass phenomenon as if nothing has substantially changed in this area. This seemingly irrational situation, this thesis argues, is a daily symptom of an ethno-political resistance to being interpellated by the AK Party as citizens-in-the-making expected to compare past and present, realize the progress and thus appreciate the current quality of healthcare provision by tolerating some persisting shortcomings. This thesis reveals that the history of state-citizen relations in Hakkâri, that is, the firmly established conviction on the part of Hakkârians that their lives count for little in the eyes of the Turkish state, and the strong egalitarian insistence on “here” and “now”, which is not tolerant of any “in the making” talk, are two factors that prevent the majority of Hakkârians from subscribing to any transition narrative. This thesis makes three main contributions to scholarly research. First of all, it is an ethnographic contribution to studies on the nationalism-social policy nexus through fieldwork consisting of semi-structured interviews with medical specialists and GPs, unstructured interviews with members and administrators of NGOs, illness and treatment narratives of patients, questionnaire research implemented in family health centers, and field notes and participatory observations. Combining its findings with insights provided by anthropology of policy, post-colonial theory, nationalism studies, and critical social policy analysis, this thesis confirms that the use of social policy for the containment of ethno-political challenges is not a straightforward issue. Secondly, underlining the central role of social policy in contemporary Turkish state-nationalism and diagnosing patient dissatisfaction in Hakkâri as a symptom of an ethno-political resistance, this thesis reveals the necessity to revise the tendency in Turkish-Kurdish studies to identify Turkish nationalism with sovereign violence and Kurdish resistance with political unrest. Finally, this thesis does not content itself with matching evidence to available concepts and puts forward some new concepts, like “being of nation,” “becoming of nation,” “indirect state racism,” “production of space as endurance”, in the hope of enriching the toolbox of scholars of nationalism studies.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (4195k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

Authors not only established a critical understanding of the hero who came to be defined as an end-product of a careful construction (e.g., Todorova 1999, Giesen 2004a), but “new heroes” also made their mass appearance (Jones 2010). Yet, in contrast to the majority of these analyses that either concentrate on one particular hero (e.g, Verdery 1999) or on one specific period (e.g., Lundt 2010), I discuss the conceptual and aesthetic transformation of the hero. Focusing on the genre of public works of art in Berlin and Budapest from 1945 up to the present time, I study various processes of the transfiguration of the hero. Besides the linguistic and cultural connections between Berlin and Budapest beginning from the 19th century, I assumed that the two cities can represent many of the dual arguments of memory studies. On the one hand, the memory politics of the so-called capitalist and socialist system is generally differentiated on the basis of the former’s disconnection and the latter’s connection to heroic traditions. On the other hand, the post-1989 memory politics of Berlin and Budapest seemingly also represent the opposite end of the scale: while in Germany, parallel to the strengthening of a perpetrator discourse, heroes became “cultural taboos”, in Hungary, along with the intensification of self-victimization narratives, the need for historical role models grew. The point of departure of my dissertation is a comprehensive database that I have compiled during my field work and that lists public works of art installed between 1945 and 2012 in Berlin and Budapest. Utilizing these records as a basis of my theses, I apply the multidisciplinary approach of a sociological aesthetics (Simmel 1968a) in order to discuss the abstract and visual transfiguration of the hero. Throughout the dissertation, I not only diminish the sharp opposition between the socialist and capitalist system, but I also show that in Berlin heroes are reemerging, whereas in Budapest heroic narratives are undergoing a crisis. I argue that in both cases there is an unambiguous trend towards reinventing the concept and form of the hero through the notion of everyday man and everydayness. However, currently everyday heroes seem to occupy different registers in the two cities. In Berlin, the memory of the so-called “silent heroes” – who as everyday men helped people persecuted during the Second World War – appeared as an unofficial memory that meanwhile has also been institutionalized. In Budapest, the official memory of 56 revolutionaries – who are primarily represented as everyday men – disintegrated that brought about the emergence of various unofficial projects. Therefore, I argue that while in Berlin everyday heroes overtake the official function of traditional heroes as historical, social and cultural models for future societies, in Budapest they resurface in the field of alternative art projects.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (13242k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Considering that in contemporary capitalism a significant amount of wealth is created through the application of intellectual effort to existing knowledge to produce new, higher compositions of knowledge that can be privately monetized as intellectual property, the challenge that Free Software might present to capitalism is bound to have important transformational potential. This potential needs to be studied both on an empirical level, in its partial and concrete manifestations in actual projects, and investigated more theoretically, to see if Free Software can be characterized as a nascent, new mode of production. This dissertation aims to contribute to the theorization of the relation between Free Software as a commons and the tenets of informational capitalism by means of an analytical study that is supported by an ethnography of a particular instance of Free Software as a project and a community. In the theoretical part, I analyze in what ways and to what extent Free Software is incorporated into and comes into conflict with informational capitalism. I consider the contributions as well as the limitations of the liberal progressive and classical revolutionary perspectives on Free Software, pointing out the necessity of seeking to explain it as a revolutionary mode of production on its own terms, as the 'transcendent synthesists' do. I then move on to contribute to such an explanation by analyzing three major aspects of Free Software with a claim to capture what is idiosyncratic in it as a mode of production: the forms of remuneration for labor, the emerging class position of the producers, and a specific, radical form of decision making within the sphere of production.  My empirical analysis consists of an ethnographic study of the Free Software community in Turkey with a focus on the Pardus project, the largest experiment with Free Software production undertaken yet in Turkey, under the aegis of the Scientific and Technological Research Council. It seeks to exemplify and complicate my theoretical characterizations by focusing on the community of various actors such as volunteers, employees, users, and academics within and around the project. By means of extended interviews with Pardus programmers, the observation of public conventions, online ethnography of convention archives, social media sites, blogs, and related company or university web pages, I explore how the development of the project is influenced by institutional and cultural-political concerns, the different motivations and perceptions of individuals participating in it, and the social movement aspect of the Free Software community. The Pardus project's bell-shaped historical trajectory of success and its entanglement in Turkish politics reveal important insights into the uneasy relationship of Free Software with capitalism on both micro and nation-state scales."", 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (740k)'}"

Based on 18 months anthropological research amongst auto rickshaw drivers, moving vendors and housing brokers, this dissertation analyses the expectant urbanism which characterises the rhythmic patterns of everyday life in Mangaluru, a smaller city in coastal south India. Mangaluru (previously Mangalore) has long been a vibrant trading centre, with a natural harbour, international airport, all weather port and well connected bus and rail stations. It is also known as an education hub, with domestic and international students studying at the slew of private and state colleges that stretch up the coast; has a reputation for active and occasionally violent vigilante moral policemen; and has a uncertain future, as the west flowing river that serves its growing population may soon be partially diverted eastwards at source.  Employing a rhythmic analytical lens, the research explores how the ongoing process of urbanisation structures and de-structures urban inhabitants' lives. Starting from a movement and experience centred understanding of the city, a Lefebvrian triadic dialectal model is utilised as a base analytical frame, allowing for a simultaneous analysis of the material, abstract and creative aspects of everyday urbanism. Cross-cutting this – and with the help of Karnatic (south Indian classical) music – a distinction is made between rhythm (laya) and rhythmic modes (tala), which it is argued have a relationship akin to urbanisation and the city. Urbanisation produces the times and spaces into which the different rhythmic modes of the city unfold.  There is a rhythmic mode whenever gestures are repeated in a sequence. However, because rhythmic patterns are socially produced (they do not exist in abstract isolation, but unfold through relations), rhythmic modes are also variously synchronised, coherent and in motion in relation to other rhythmic modes. However, the city's historically and contextually contingent heterogeneity destabilises the relational rhythmic categories of coherence, synchrony and motion. The flowing together of powerful, weak, fast, slow, confused, angry, dominated, domestic, religious, labour-based, human, non-human and climatic rhythmic modes, imbues the city's rhythmic relations with tension – thus the city is also a place of (in)coherent motion(less) (a)synchrony.  In Indian cities, which are concentrating, expanding and differentiating under capitalistic urbanisation, the cumulative and aggregative affect of these modes is a rhythmic presence of irregular regularity. In Mangaluru, this irregular regularity moulds itself into an expectant urbanism; an urban culture that moves with a prospective gait, drawing on the promises, hopes and aspirations of urban futures that wind themselves into the everyday life of the city.   Inhabiting such a city is a skill – an urban navigation that relies on a combination of attention (in relation to the moving environment), intention (in relation to social structures) and cultivation (in relation to ethical exemplars), as urbanites move through the city and through their lives. Three particular skilled practices are analysed in-depth – the linking work of housing and land brokers, the learning of the city by moving vendors, and the various types of waiting undertaken by auto rickshaw drivers."", 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (4804k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

It argues that sport has been instrumental for national unification, integration, and homogenization and for the consolidation of the Romanian state. In their turn, I show that these pressures operated to produce a distinctively Romanian sporting tradition premised on the Romanians perceived Latin “élan”. Romania’s extensive territorial expansion in the aftermath of the First World War inaugurated a historical conjuncture dominated by the need to affirm the new polity both domestically and internationally. At the same time, regional unevenness, ethnic diversity, conflicting views of modernization and development and a turbulent international environment heavily affected the structure, operation and results of the interwar Romanian state. The ascendance of modern sports and of programs of physical education during the early decades of the twentieth century made them into obvious and relatively ready available institutions to pursue these goals. Hence, I show that sports and physical education were soon taken up and encouraged by members of the Romanian elite in their effort to affirm Romanianness. This process was nowhere more visible and critical than in the region of Transylvania, where urban spaces were overwhelmingly non-Romanian and Hungarian, Jewish or German sporting clubs and associations were already in place since imperial times. Consequently, to explore the critical and often neglected role of sport in the making of the Romanian nation-state the current work is built around a case study of Universitatea Cluj, the par excellence Romanian club in Transylvania. Founded in 1919, the students’ sports association at the University of Cluj was a quintessential vehicle in establishing and safeguarding the nation locally, regionally and nationally. Universitatea’s history confounds with the history of Romanian administration in Transylvania. I devote major attention to the football section of the club, by far the most popular sport in Romania ever since the early interwar. The analysis of the club’s emergence, of its history and of the memories it triggered among its members afford crucial insights into the ways in which football worked to both support and undermine nation making and state consolidation. As an institution of sportsmen/intellectuals, a rarely observed sociological category, the analysis of its historical trajectory adds new facets to the making of modern sport. Moreover, Universitatea’s historically low levels of sporting achievement allow for a history of football rarely underwritten by performance and glory, as is often the case. This is a history of identification, loyalty and belonging that could do without sporting triumph in affirming and widely popularizing the national values that it stood for. In conjunction with the national developments that I explore, the case of “Universitatea” makes for a particularly interesting history of sport, nation and state, one where a rhetorics of cultivating bodies, minds and souls produced a sporting culture at odds with modern and contemporary developments in sport. To show that, wherever possible, I trace the history of the ideas that have animated Universitatea and the Romanian movements of sports and physical education beyond their formative years during the interwar into Romanian socialism and post-socialism. Overall, the dissertation refines and adds substance to oft-repeated claims that sports are essential in the making of modern nation-states and endorses understandings of modern nationalism that stress its Janus-faced character.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (1419k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

By focusing on everyday lives of the plantation labourers in the South Nyanza sugarbelt, the dissertation reveals the nature and dynamic of development generally and the large scale commercial farming economy in particular as unpredictable and chaotic. What is more significant from the findings is the demonstrated acceptance, integration and accommodation of chaos into the constitutive and operational logic of the plantation economy and its development itinerary. Throughout the dissertation, the relations between the agromanufacturing complex as a structure designed for modernization intervention and the invisible everyday lives of those in its orbit are shown to be characterized by unpredictability, contradictions, differentiations, violence, deprivations and exploitative dispossession. Combined, these make lives under such development interventions insecure, disjointed, vulnerable and disorderly. My study contributes to the sociology and social anthropology of development by proposing a fresh look at development interventions as ‘chaotic projects’ which produce disorder rather than smooth solutions to technical disorder. Such a look, building on works of other such as Tania Li and James Ferguson, integrates the ideas of Foucault to show how development has in effect become a series of normalizations where more attention is focused on making things seem normal rather actually transforming them. For instance, the study shows how dispossession of land, labour and employment safeguards are part of repertoire of tactics employed to enhance efficiency and productivity in the factory though they expose the plantation workers and villagers to extreme deprivation and invisibility. Furthermore, the study responds to the significant absence of a disciplinary society approach to development related research in Africa though much of the interventions are implemented as disciplinary projects. By combining Foucault’s conception of power and the concept of chaos in studying agromanufacturing as development in Kenya, the study shows how development is not only chaotic but sustained by chaos: under development, disorder is the order.

In addition, they are produced by interested actors with stakes in various fields – markets and policy fields. Through a combination of the performativity approach to economy and markets with the theory of fields, the thesis describes and analyzes the embeddedness of the ETS organization in politics taking place within and across these fields. Embeddedness of emissions trade thus appears to be complex and layered; and its organization has to be defined as a dynamic process whereby interests are articulated, negotiated and stabilized.  The interest of the Polish case in such a study resides in the peculiar place of the energy sector in the Polish economy. More particularly, large shares of coal in electricity production (93%) within a fairly isolated, mostly state-owned and aging electricity sector make any environmentalist reform of coal production and use immensely costly to this country. This has generated fierce resistance to the EU’s ETS plans and set in motion a complex process of interest mobilization and formation with significant impact on final outcomes.

Second it discusses various assets/dynamics that serve the local actors to mobilize multi-scalar networks for “jumping scales” and defining particular trajectories under neoliberalism (such as ethnicity, local history, local politics).

It examines the multiple ways of being, becoming, and conceiving oneself as a citizen by engaging with or circumventing the state in its different faces through simultaneous normative and institutional incorporation in more than one polity and social context. Drawing on a year-long ethnographic multi-sited research of a migrant community spreading between a village in Bulgaria and a small town in Spain, it aims at unpacking the everyday struggles and negotiations of individuals embedded as semi-insiders/semi-outsiders at the margins of two states. As part of a process of ‘citizenship disaggregation and re-articulation’ migrants claim rights and membership by positioning themselves simultaneously within these multiple institutional contexts, making up for what they lack in one site by seeking it elsewhere. By working on the vertical and the horizontal relations that citizenship entails in these two contexts the migrants described here manage to assemble the different elements of their fragmented citizenship. However, I argue that the case of the Bulgarian Muslim migrants reveals not only the agentic process of assembling citizenship elements, but also the hidden inequalities contained in the concept of European citizenship in a pan-European space where free movement is linked to labour migration and demands participation in the accumulation of capital. In this context those who fall outside the category of regular workers - workers who shift between statuses of regularity and irregularity, and women and ageing relatives, who are engaged in reproductive labour sustaining the migrant family - are trapped in precarious positions and lose citizenship rights both at home and in migration. Although the EU space allows an overall economic improvement of migrant families’ wellbeing, the empowering potential of the process of assembling citizenship fragments is only enacted by the limited group of male regular workers, while new insecurities and dependencies emerge for the rest of the migrants in a highly gendered and age-dependent way.

It is an exploration of processes that determined the social (re)production of inequalities and brought about social change under successive government regimes prior to, during, and after Communism. To this end, it is also an historical account of the ways in which successive generations of individual families have been and are being affected by the political and economic changes over the past decades, and the ways in which they mobilized their resources attempting to create more secure lives. Through the lens of how struggles for housing and land conditioned the lives of families, and brought about or eased poverty over time, the thesis examines the ways in which families have been able to create or seize ‘openings’ in structures of power and thus shape the ‘time-spaces’ of their lives. At the same time, by analyzing urban property relations, the research uncovers the ways in which layers of inequalities have, for decades, been produced and superimposed upon local actors in urban Romania, often deterring and limiting their efforts to “get by” in their everyday lives.  The complex methodological approach of the thesis – the use of life and family histories in combination with ethnographic and archival research – made possible the analysis of poverty and inequalities at many different scales, and from many different angles. The findings highlight the relational and interactional aspects of reproduction as it happens both at the very intimate individual and family levels and at the broader socio-structural level. The analysis reveals how life history narratives of the poor engaged in a dialog with broader social discourses on inequalities, and exposes the ways narrators’ perceptions influenced their actions in relation to structural contexts. Further, it shows how, in hierarchical and/or unequal structures and relationships, actors occupying different positions in social space often employ similar strategies to hold on to what they have, keep others at bay, and increase their own capital. In this context, the thesis examines at great length how individuals and families – depending on their social, cultural, and economic capital, but also on their social relations and networks – were able to cope with poverty and inequalities over the decades. Finally, the thesis makes clear that considering these approaches together helps to avoid some of the pitfalls seen in broader poverty literature that often emerge from, on the one hand, seeing structural constraints as totally limiting and debilitating human lives, inevitably leading to reproduction, and on the other hand, seeing human agency as over-empowering in relation to structural constraints over the course of a lifetime.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (8243k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unestricted'}"

The capitalist scalar restructuring along with the post-1989 state decentralisation and accession to the EU has brought a variety of new opportunities for remote rural places, but has also produced manifold insecurities. Extending the theoretical framework of neoliberal state restructuring to rural localities outside the core economies allows for a critique of the popular interpretation that the ‘post-socialist transition’ can explain Hungary’s current wide-scale unemployment, entrenched poverty, ethnic tensions, high levels of individual indebtedness and uneven development. This dissertation utilises ethnographic methods to delineate the present form of these processes with a particular emphasis on the practices of local state officials in three crucial areas: social security, development and access to resources. The responsibilities in these areas are shifting from the centre to the local state and to individuals and their families, resulting in a rescaling of insecurities. The dissertation examines the social processes through which state rescaling is taking place, the ways local officials/inhabitants cope with the consequent rescaling of insecurities and the ways these reconfigure the relationship between rural inhabitants and the state. It is argued that the consequences of this state rescaling on social citizenship can be only captured by a spatially sensitive conceptualisation of citizenship, which integrates the experience of rural inhabitants. Delineating what rural citizenship might entail, it is shown that such a conceptualisation should not only encompass rights, obligations and claim making but should also take into account: 1) interactions between inhabitants and state officials (the spatial closeness of state actors and citizens); 2) positionality (the unequal relations between localities and scales in the continuously shifting global hierarchy); 3) relations to place (the belonging and identity citizens ascribe to their locality).', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (3380k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Drawing on the fieldwork conducted among Ukrainian care- and domestic workers in Bologna and Naples, my research has indicated the centrality of motherhood in such familial migration projects led by women. To bring out dynamic role of motherhood in imagining, strategizing and carrying migration I introduce an analytical distinction between motherhood as a trope and motherhood as a situational practice. Such distinction between the two allows me to address the very mechanism of justifying, making sense of and dealing with the unequally distributed responsibilities within migrants transnational social fields, and to capture the emotion work and negotiations that shape these fields and the power struggles within them.  Though motherhood has been addressed extensively in transnational literature dealing with migration of women from the global South to the global North, neither the studies which analyze Ukrainian migration to Italy under motherhood as trope nor those which analyze through the lens of motherhood as experience are able to capture the multifaceted dynamics of shifting of meanings and practices that allow women to deal with prolonged absences and resist blaming discourses of both Italian and Ukrainian states that often surround female mobility. Shifting within their positions in transnational social fields between the modes of motherhood at home and in migration, women learn to engage in a variety of economic social and intimate relationships and turn migration into a beneficial project worth undertaking. Seeing how motherhood as an idealized trope is translated into the situational practices not only at the intersection of migration and family, but also at the the site where migration brings rupture into women’s professional and personal lives this dissertation explores how women daily shift between various regimes of performativity and identification, which enables them to maximize earnings, maintain personal integrity, keep ties within the transnational families, feel strong about themselves, protect themselves from the pressure of the pubic opinion and various forms of exploitations.', 'Access': 'Degree: PhD', 'System Det': 'PDF file (5095k)'}"

To this end, the analysis includes four groups of intellectuals: the Unionists from the very late period of the Ottoman Empire, the Kemalists from the early republican period, the conservatives from the single and the multi-party eras, and the leftwing intellectuals from the 1960s and the 1970s. Historically, Turkish intellectuals have been experiencing being on the border of the West; since the West and Europe have been a source of inspiration for progress and a general reference point in establishing modernity, yet at the same time, a threat for their country in the realm of the realpolitik. This constitutes the main dilemma investigated in this dissertation. This study argues that, for a comprehensive history of the global hierarchies in the nineteenth century, the buffer zones between the European metropolis and the formally colonized peripheries need to be focused on. As such, as a background for the intellectuals’ criticism in the twentieth century, the subjugation of the Ottoman Empire by the European Great Powers throughout the nineteenth century is analyzed by referring to a complex network of informal colonialism, arguing that Ottoman modernization was a search for increasing the state capacity to counter this subjugation. This study highlights that the idea of “saving the state,” which dominated the modernization efforts both in the Unionist and the early republican eras, should be conceptualized as system integration in the terminology of historical sociology. Referring to this historical background of “space of subjugation,” it is argued that for those Turkish intellectuals, facing Eurocentrism included colonial criticism and critical awareness about global hierarchies. Imagining modernity in their locality necessitated challenging the superiority claims of Europe and searching for parity and recognition. The interplay between facing Eurocentrism and facing modernity has always raised the issue of nativism, as it is commonly observed that criticizing Eurocentrism was coupled with essentialist superiority claims of identity. Thus, the issue of nativism is discussed separately for each group of intellectuals scrutinized in this study. The analyses reveal that most of the intellectuals in question had to assume multiple intellectual roles simultaneously, being rational planner, legislator, and interpreter at the same time, due to the necessity of reconciling different universalist positions with the peculiarities of their societies and the necessity of countering prejudices against their culture.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2918k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The thesis answers this question through an analysis of two inter-linked processes: firstly, the cyclical social movement dynamics of increasing disillusionment with - and distantiation from - the class-based platforms that led earlier struggles for emancipation but could not, once in government, structurally alter existing relations of power. And secondly, the political-economic processes associated with ""neoliberalism"" that changed the everyday working lives of subaltern groups in Kerala in such as way as to make them more amenable to indigenism than to the older forms of ""class-based"" mobilization. Through an analysis of these processes, this thesis makes a critical contribution to the wider debate on the causes and meanings of the global rise of indigenous identity politics at this juncture in the capitalist world system.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (1815k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

The theoretical anchorage of my argument is that of autonomist Marxism, which argues that capital should be analyzed from the perspective of the struggling subjects. I focus on the level of the representation of reality as one of the sites in which this struggle is visible. The study is situated in a particular historical context in which capitalism is being forcefully presented as the right systemic alternative to the morally, socially and economically wrong socialism of the past. Capitalism is not only built with the ruins of socialism, but also by keeping its ghost alive. I consequently analyze the role of the pervasive and hegemonic anti-communist discourse in preventing the elements of reformist critique (which denounce reality as unjust, but within the overarching framework that holds capitalism itself as a just system) to be coagulated into radical critique (which would put in doubt the very fairness of capitalism and would make claims of alternative modes of co-production). Analytically, I take my informants indignations and satisfaction with their jobs (the way in which their involvement in the circuits of production takes place) and larger environments as indicators of the dimensions on which they put reality to test and as the entry point into the mechanisms through which they formulate critique. I argue that sociologies of domination such as orthodox Marxism contribute to making the coagulation of radical critique more difficult because of the fact that their theoretical position does not allow them to recognize analytically any exterior to capitalism as we speak and live. Therefore, I use my case to make a more general plea for critical sociology to place the political implications of the narratives it produces at the heart of its theorizing. I rely primarily on working life histories of middle managers and a solid contextualization of these narratives in the economic trajectory of the city, its ethnicity cum class history, together with an account of the series of reforms in the national system of higher education. I argue that their careers are unfolding in a career field which has been gradually growing more institutionalized and structured and I describe the main parameters of these changes. Using Sequence Analysis as a method and logic of analyzing temporal data, I engage with the hypothesis of the increased flexibility of contemporary careers and suggest several dimensions that are relevant for accounting for the diversity of trajectories.', 'Local note': 'Degree: PhD', 'Access': 'PDF file (912k)', 'System Det': 'ETD'}"

It aims to explain how we got to the point, in which this way of doing business, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurship” in Berlin, became capable of being discussed and regarded as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. What is at stake is the discontinuity - acceptance of “ethnic entrepreneurship” - rather than trying to fit this singular event into a “natural flow of history”. This does not mean that it sets up chance over plans or principles in the interpretation of history. Rather, it intends to demonstrate that it was not self-evident that “ethnic entrepreneurship” as such had been accepted, defined and still has been discussed as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. Hence, I look at the conditions of possibility by seeking out once again the links, which at a particular moment shape the self-evident. Deriving from these goals, the dissertation falls into two parts. In the first part (genealogical), I concentrate on the historical features of “ethnic entrepreneurship” and examine conditions of possibility in Berlin under the context of Germany and its regional and global relatedness through the rationalities and imaginations of policy makers, experts and intellectuals. In the second part (anthropological), I explore first, the ways individuals perform themselves as “ethnic entrepreneurs”; second, rules for this way doing things; and third, truth claims (as sphere where true and false can be carried out) for providing reasons about this way of doing things.  Within this structure, the contribution of this dissertation can be drawn from its objective: to challenge the binary opposition that emerges through the ways of thinking about “ethnic entrepreneurship”. This binary opposition is between the pre-given or essentialist understanding of culture and the “welcoming” understanding of diverse cultural co-existence. The former, associating a space with a pre-given identity and considering its existence as natural, underlines particular ways of doing businesses by “ethnic entrepreneurs”. The latter, acknowledging socially embeddedness of these economic agents in laws, institutions and social networks, “welcomes” their richness, potential and competence in doing business with the concepts like “transcultural”, “multicultural” and “cosmopolitan”. As a result of this relation, one enters a domain, where conflicting true and false discourses can be produced and re-produced in a continuous manner through exclusive (the former) and inclusive (the latter) formulations of culture. It is this binary opposition that I aim to challenge, since both of these approaches function as mechanisms of othering. By pursuing this goal, the dissertation illustrates how human beings have been turned into subjects, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurs”.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2556k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

The concept of gender rather treated as an isolated category than as a social factor which intersects with other categories of identity for purposes of understanding and combating inequality. The aim of this dissertation has been to explain and analyze through empirical material the manifestations of gender, ethnicity and class in contemporary Romani women’s life. To narrow my study, I have focused on transnational and local (particularly Hungarian) Romani women’s political activism and social status, from the structural through the discursive and biographical level. I aimed to go beyond the superficial representation of women’s activism, by describing the complicated relationship and intercations among donors, NGOs, other Roma and non-Roma activists, and also within their groups. With the above outlined concerns in my mind, I undertook an empirical research project at the transnational level (mapping the various Roma networks and international resource centers) and at the local level (Szikszó, Hungary). As part of my research, I closely observed “women’s issues” at the transnational and the local level, as well as discourses and activities through which they promote “Romani women’s rights” and “human rights and democracy” under the banners of “empowering Romani women”. This area is under-researched and lacks theoretical conceptualization. The approach I have opted to take bridges empirical and theoretical gaps in the study of sociology and anthropology, particularly in respect of the representation of Roma in the academic text as well as to raise the profile of the research field by diminishing the marginalized position of them within the social sciences as a whole.', 'File Type': 'Degree: PhD', 'Local note': 'PDF file (2324k)', 'Access': 'ETD', 'System Det': 'Unrestricted'}"

Each (Italian, Dutch, British and American) version of capitalism produced in Poland a distinct socio-economic system. Different material landscapes shared, however, an underlining social structure. In Part One, I analyze how the Biblical “curse of Ham” was localized in Poland in the 16th century, and how it fossilized class boundaries and engendered a social stratum of chamstwo - unskilled agricultural laborers. During the Dutch hegemony chamstwo was a racial category. During the British-style industrialization it became associated with ethnicity, and employed to stigmatize the nascent German and Jewish urban nouveau riche. After 1945, when Poland turned from an agricultural to an urban society, chamstwo ceased being associated with a specific social group, became psychologized, and nowadays it denotes uncouth, disrespectful, and boorish behavior in public, mainly urban, space. Part Two describes the intense struggles over the right to the city in the immediate postwar period, and how the spontaneous mixing of groups and milieus propelled old class divisions to reemerge on a new turf. Part Three describes how the “secret” of modern chamstwo, the fear of physical proximity, spurred new forms of material separation in projects of urban renewal, suburbanization, proto-gentrification and refashioning of inner-city that took place in the period I call “the long 1960s” (1956-1976). Since it was followed by a protracted crisis (1980-2003), Polish cities, and the modern Polish society, I argue, were largely shaped back then. The post-war urbanization of chamstwo reveals that although material landscapes “melt into thin air,” they always are anchored in deep-seated and largely abstract class structures. The astonishingly protean nature of chamstwo, its ability to adapt to new circumstances and reinvent itself, and facilitate both spatial and temporal uneven development in the longue durée, is what I call the cunning of class.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (7526k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"

With focusing on the internal stratification of the inmate world, the thesis hopes to contribute to Goffman’s analysis of total institutions (Goffman 1961). The thesis sets out to test Charles Tilly’s hypotheses about organizations (re)producing durable inequalities; their tendency to take over existing strong and categorical inequalities out of convenience, which helps them accomplish other organizational work (Tilly 1998). The analysis demonstrates that a robust inmate hierarchy is in place in the Kalocsa prison. While members of the elite are the extended arm of prison administration, a group of women are stigmatized as bad girls and warehoused until the day of their release; while the great majority of women are made disciplined workers. The thesis introduces the sorting mechanisms - e.g. job placement; or placement to cell - and the categories the prison uses - e.g. reliability, presentability - to distribute women in the various subgroups. The analysis uncovers the often direct translation between these internal categories and external inequalities – such as for instance the definition of Roma women as unreliable workers – and the resulting massive inequalities along the prison’s internal hierarchies. The thesis is built on ethnographic and participatory research conducted with women at Kalocsa, the largest women’s prison in Hungary, during the years between 2003 and 2009. The research is based on women’s experiences of imprisonment; the data collected during in-prison interviews and two series of seminars conducted in Kalocsa; as well as follow-up interviews and conversations with women following their release. The key contribution of the research is the demonstration that a prison may produce and reproduce inequalities among groups of inmates in order to reinforce discipline and strengthen its legitimacy. These internal inequalities, if they are identical with existing strong social inequalities outside the prison walls, can remain invisible and strong stabilizing mechanism and may provide low-cost and convenient internal controls. If these inequalities are as deeply institutionalized into the prison’s operations as they are in Kalocsa; these can assist the prison in times of change in adsorbing new principles and in adjusting to the new circumstances without changing the basic disciplinary system. As such, inequalities may be one of the mechanisms that produce carceral clawback (Carlen 2002): prison’s remarkable ability to resist and transform reform efforts so that changes ultimately do not threaten its basic operation.', 'Note': 'Degree: PhD', 'File Type': 'PDF file (983k)', 'Local note': 'ETD', 'Access': 'Unrestricted', 'System Det': 'System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer'}"
