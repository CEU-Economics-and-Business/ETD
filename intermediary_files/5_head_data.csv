Recently, the frequent strikes by health workers have brought to light the fact that as a country we have an inefficient system that has gone unchecked for such a long time. It also highlights that the country’s priorities are not aligned with the global development agenda where improving health is one of the key pillars. In this paper, I elaborately paint a picture of the country’s healthcare system with special focus on the increasing frequency of health worker strikes. The country’s political climate in the recent past has been tense and implementing processes geared towards change is taking longer than expected. Considering this, I highlight the problems that the country is facing focusing on the collective bargaining agreement that has long been ignored and delve deeper into how this fits into the global picture. While doing so, I discuss in detail the shortcomings of the system, the reasons for these shortcomings and what has been done so far to address the existing problems. In addition to this, the paper gives policy recommendations drawn from systems around the world. Some of the cited recommendations have been implemented in other developing countries and have proven effective.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1524k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

All four models suggest that Bitcoin closing price was overstated during the period. The analysis also detects Bitcoin features that could lead to the behavioral bias on the cryptocurrency market. The study suggests that investorsâ€™ behavior on the crypto market should be investigated more within behavioral finance.,Degree: MA,PDF file (669k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,
