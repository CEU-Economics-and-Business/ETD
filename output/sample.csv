It is especially true if difference and differentiation are conceived at the level of optics – entailing emerging and circulating classifications and conceptions of (in)commensurability – instead of representations. The state border between Belarus and Lithuania, in many of its parts inhabited by Polish population from both sides, constitutes a distinctive example of a restricted geopolitical border – the external one of the EU – that replaced clearly formal and not corresponding to any existed cultural division – yet not inconsequential – administrative line from the Soviet times. The local effect of the state-work in the production of estrangement is examined in the thesis, as well as the circulating notions of the meaning(lessness) of the border. One scrutinised dimension of this process is the emotional experience of the factual separation, established by restrictive visa regimes and border control. On the other hand, emotional modalities, through which personal experiences of the divide are expressed, are tightly interconnected with ‘the sense of border’ at its ideational level. This, in turn, leads to further exploration of the dynamics of the popular conceptualisation of the emerged difference, expressed through the vocabulary of ‘civilizational’ and geopolitical meanings produced by the states and utilised by popular political imagination. Further on, possibiliеties of critical engagement with both existing scholarship on post-socialist borders and the ontological turn in anthropology are outlined.",Degree: MA,PDF file (523k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

O’Connor and Kenter’s Life Framework of Values (LFV) is an innovative and comprehensible means to communicate intrinsic and relational values, which are conceived of as related to living with, from, in and as the more-than-human world. The LFV seeks to operationalize intrinsic values in the context of conservation and sustainability. This thesis brings perspectives from Latour and Haraway to bear on environmental ethics discussions, especially around intrinsic and relational values. The work of Latour and Haraway expands the understanding of the more-than-human world, examines conceptions of nature and wilderness, looks at nature/culture interaction and proposes the inclusion of the Gaia and the Anthropocene as essential conceptual frameworks. Latour and Haraway’s work on relationality provides insight into the LFV. Latour’s actor-network theory increases the range of entities and objects that participate in networks and gives these actors greater agency. The concept of the Anthropocene means that relations between the human and the more-than-human have become central forces, and provides historical, political and economic background to the current ecological crisis. Acceptance of the Anthropocene and Gaia means that we exist in a limited critical zone. Latour and Haraway argue against universalizing ethical systems. Latour advocates ethical sensitization and Haraway argues for situated knowledge and attention to entanglement and injustice. The combination of these insights might be used to strengthen and improve the LFV.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (1039k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

The response to the call for the demonstration was overwhelming and launched an 18-day sit-in within Tahrir Square in Cairo, as well as other sit-ins and demonstrations throughout Egypt and solidarity demonstrations in front of Egyptian embassies abroad, ultimately leading to deposing the former president Muhammad Husni Mubarak in February 2011. Between February 2011 and August 2013, a lifetime’s worth of violent and polarizing clashes and confrontations took place. The end result of these clashes and confrontations is the reinstatement of a military-led authoritarian regime that is cracking down on individual and collective liberties, enforcing harsh austerity measures under the guise of neo-liberal reform, and an increased sense of embitterment concerning living in Egypt. Within the experience of the Revolution, I investigate ‘revolutionary purity’ as a simultaneously powerful and ambiguous force, born out of an Arabic tradition of linking ‘Revolution’ and ‘Purity’ that influenced the trajectory of the Revolution in Egypt. By bringing together the life stories of active participants in the Revolution and my autoethnography as a witness of the Revolution from a distance, I argue that revolutionary purity came into being between the personal and the political; the revolutionaries’ personal aspirations and frustrations, and their unfolding modes of politicization throughout the lifetime of the Revolution. I also claim that revolutionary purity didn’t exist solely within the realm of the Revolution and its time. Its inception can be traced back to the everyday lives of people before the Revolution, as well as today through the experiences of revolutionaries living through the despair of the defeat of the Revolution.",Degree: MA,PDF file (484k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

In my thesis, I argue that, in principle, statistical evidence can be a basis for knowledge and conviction, and there is no rationale for discriminating against statistical evidence; the intuitive difference between non-statistical and statistical evidence is merely psychological and can be understood in the light of consideration like the historical development of our intuitions. * * * First, I suggest some scenarios in which the belief is based on statistical evidence yet, according to the criteria from many accounts of knowledge in the market for knowledge. To extend knowledge assignment to even more cases of statistical evidence, I apply a famous distinction from Wilfrid Sellars between ‘manifest image’ and ‘scientific image’ of the world and ourselves to the case of knowledge; I enumerate some of the problems with the intuitive notion of knowledge, discuss some historical considerations to better understand such intuitive reactions and, briefly, explore the possibility of a move towards a more scientific notion of knowledge which not only allows knowledge assignment to many cases with statistical evidence but also can help with addressing some long-lasting issues in epistemology.  Then, I turn to a parallel issue with statistical evidence in the context of legal cases. Discussing three proposals to distinguish the non-statistical and statistical evidence, I argue that none of them manages to provide an independent rationale for such discrimination.  Finally, I address some worries about the reliability of the current statistical methods that are used to produce statistical evidence as well as some concerns regarding the applicability of statistical methods to particular cases and propose some criteria that can help to decide whether a piece of statistical evidence is relevant and can be used as a basis for judgment in each scenario.",Degree: MA,PDF file (728k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

By utilizing theories of nationalism, gender, and the state, this thesis seeks to examine the complexities of the postwar reality for survivors of wartime sexual violence in Kosovo and the impacts of gendered nationalism on state-level policy and recognition for survivors. Two dominant narratives have been established: that of the European aspirational ideal and of the Albanian ethno-national invocation of masculine war heroes and freedom fighters. Sexual violence – and victimhood in general – did not fit into these state narratives, further impacting policy priorities. In parallel with dominant state narratives, the taken for granted androcentrism of the state apparatus continues to impact recognition of survivors of wartime sexual violence. I analyze the 2014 Amendment to the Law on Civilian Victims of War in light of the current application process for state-level benefits for survivors, and argue that the Amendment does well to support some survivors, while still maintaining state narratives of singular, ethnic priorities. Thus, since my research is situated in a particular time when survivors are finally able to access state recognition and benefits, the further implications of masculinized state priorities for women are yet to be determined, but a gender-sensitive lens towards state-level support is imperative for survivors.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

It aims to explain how we got to the point, in which this way of doing business, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurship” in Berlin, became capable of being discussed and regarded as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. What is at stake is the discontinuity - acceptance of “ethnic entrepreneurship” - rather than trying to fit this singular event into a “natural flow of history”. This does not mean that it sets up chance over plans or principles in the interpretation of history. Rather, it intends to demonstrate that it was not self-evident that “ethnic entrepreneurship” as such had been accepted, defined and still has been discussed as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. Hence, I look at the conditions of possibility by seeking out once again the links, which at a particular moment shape the self-evident. Deriving from these goals, the dissertation falls into two parts. In the first part (genealogical), I concentrate on the historical features of “ethnic entrepreneurship” and examine conditions of possibility in Berlin under the context of Germany and its regional and global relatedness through the rationalities and imaginations of policy makers, experts and intellectuals. In the second part (anthropological), I explore first, the ways individuals perform themselves as “ethnic entrepreneurs”; second, rules for this way doing things; and third, truth claims (as sphere where true and false can be carried out) for providing reasons about this way of doing things.  Within this structure, the contribution of this dissertation can be drawn from its objective: to challenge the binary opposition that emerges through the ways of thinking about “ethnic entrepreneurship”. This binary opposition is between the pre-given or essentialist understanding of culture and the “welcoming” understanding of diverse cultural co-existence. The former, associating a space with a pre-given identity and considering its existence as natural, underlines particular ways of doing businesses by “ethnic entrepreneurs”. The latter, acknowledging socially embeddedness of these economic agents in laws, institutions and social networks, “welcomes” their richness, potential and competence in doing business with the concepts like “transcultural”, “multicultural” and “cosmopolitan”. As a result of this relation, one enters a domain, where conflicting true and false discourses can be produced and re-produced in a continuous manner through exclusive (the former) and inclusive (the latter) formulations of culture. It is this binary opposition that I aim to challenge, since both of these approaches function as mechanisms of othering. By pursuing this goal, the dissertation illustrates how human beings have been turned into subjects, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurs”.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2556k),ETD,Unrestricted,Turks -- Germany,,PhD

This inquiry involves an interdisciplinary approach, combining history, theology, philosophy, and philology. At the beginning of the fourth century, after Christianity changed its status from persecuted to official recognition in the Roman Empire, an “ascetic revolution” spread especially among the members of the high aristocracy and of the middle-class. Sometimes several members of the same family, men and women, embraced the ascetic enthusiasm, experimenting with different ascetic modi vivendi in proximity to each other or in cohabitation. While authoritative Church Fathers legitimized some of the newly emerging communities, at the same time, they rejected other forms of double-gender asceticism, which they labelled as chaotic and “unruly.” Family double monasteries are rooted in the pious Late Antique households, generally belonging to the high aristocracy, with one notable exception – precisely the very one that had set the tone for this practice. Relatives, men and women, shared their inclination towards asceticism in proximity to each other either on their own family estates, or in new places. They formed quarters of monks and nuns who belonged to the same monastic unit, sometimes having a unique guidance (often a woman), they were economically and liturgically interdependent, but they lived separately and their encounters were thoroughly regulated. Thus, the flourishing communities which sprang from a family milieu and received the recognition of the Church Fathers are, in chronological order, the monastery of Tabennesi (Upper Egypt), founded by Pachomius and his sister, Mary (ca. 333-336); the monastery in Annisa (Cappadocia), which developed on the family estate of Macrina the Younger, her mother, and her brothers (ca. 345-356); the community founded in Bethlehem by Jerome, his brother, Paulinianus, and his spiritual daughter, Paula, together with the latter’s daughter, Eustochium (386); the monastery of Nola, founded by Paulinus and his wife, Therasia (395-396), which became a magnet for other ‘monastic spouses’ and formed a monastic network; the monastery which emerged at Primuliacum due to Sulpicius Severus, his wife, and his mother-in-law, Bassula (396-403); and the monastery founded on the Mount of Olives by Melania the Younger, her husband, Pinianus, and her mother, Albina (431-436). At the same time, other spouses renounced their matrimonial relations and continued to live as spiritual siblings in their own pious households, which they slowly transformed into ascetic dwellings, or, rarely, fled elsewhere. Not all the monastic spouses founded new communities, but some of them either joined already existent monasteries, or, after years of living in proximity, they separated. This thesis analyzed them as part of the double gender family asceticism which was recognized and legitimized. In the secondary literature scholars have been using the terminus technicus “double monastery” almost indiscriminately, for all eras and for all the regions, with the meaning of a coenobitic establishment that hosted ascetic men and women in seclusion. Generally, the term was opposed to other types of double gender communities called “mixed monasteries,” “neighbor monasteries,” or “distant monasteries.” Literature published from the nineteenth century until today distinguished two main stages of research, one lasting until the beginning of the twentieth century, and another one which started at the end of the 1980s. In this period, two disciplines, history and Church law, have been dealing with the problem of double monasteries. The syntagm “double monastery” cannot be easily applied to the fourth-century context, since the terms “duplex monasterium” and “διπλοῦν μοναστήριον” are first attested in 546, in Justinian’s Novel 123, while sources never use the other terms proposed in scholarship. However, since in English no other syntagm is able to cover accurately the particularities of the fourth- and fifth-century communities that my dissertation scrutinizes, throughout my work I conventionally referred to them by adopting the formula “family double monasteries.” Several common conditions led to the gradual development of this model of monasticism. First, a charismatic ascetic man attached to his male monastery a community of pious women who followed him and he set up a set of rules which concerned both groups of ascetics and their interaction. In other instances, men and women relatives transformed their “pious households” into ascetic establishments. In this case, they did not cease to live in the same environment, but at a later stage in their evolution, groups of monks and nuns were secluded, and a set of rules established the legitimate contacts between them. Yet, in other situations, relatives founded a community for both monks and nuns in a different place than their household. Such a place attracted other ascetically oriented family members, creating ‘monastic networks.’ Finally, in some situations, spouses decided to renounce their family connections and to become ascetics. Sources describe several stages in the accomplishment of such a decision, which had noticeable consequences at the social level. The sources pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the communities which my thesis investigates are mostly written. The hagiographies, letters, monastic rules, dialogues, homilies, sermons, and poems have their specific set of rules which concern their production, audience, and way of dissemination. Most of the sources belong to more than one category, a fact which is not surprising for the fourth-century context. Moreover, all the texts have male authors, a detail which becomes essential when analyzing references to ascetic women.....",Degree: PhD,PDF file (1861k),ETD,CEU Doctoral School of History,,PhD
