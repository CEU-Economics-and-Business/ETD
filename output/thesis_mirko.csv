First, we discuss the operator theoretic counterparts of the central ergodic theoretical notions of strong and weak mixing. These concepts correspond to particular types of asymptotic behaviour of operator semigroups in the weak operator topology, called weak and almost weak stability. Using functional analytic tools and methods from ergodic the- ory, we describe various features of (almost) weakly stable semigroups. In particular, we show that (in the Baire category sense) typical elements in certain natural spaces of semi- groups are almost weakly but not weakly stable, thus we carry over classical theorems of Halmos and Rohlin for measure preserving transformations to the Hilbert space operator setting. Further, we illustrate operator semigroup methods and results on a class of telegraph systems with various boundary conditions. We study both linear and nonlinear boundary value problems. The stability of linear telegraph systems is discussed by applying theorems from the previous chapters. For the existence of solutions, we are particularly interested in time-dependent boundary conditions, since this case has little been investigated so far. The operator semigroup techniques applied to the case of Lipschitz continuous non- linearities are combined with estimates from the theory of monotone operators to yield well-posedness and the regularity of the solutions, also in the case of dynamic boundary conditions.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (550k),ETD,Unrestricted,Measure theory,,PhD,0,1

The creation of the anthology was personally initiated by emperor Alexios Komnenos (1081-1118) and was related with the religious politics of the Byzantine Empire. In the history of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, this anthology remained as an important contribution in the systematization of the legacy of the Church Fathers and the cannon of texts which were used in the theological debates. The text gained considerable popularity with more than Greek 150 manuscripts and translations into Old Slavonic and Latin. The Panoplia consists of 28 chapters. Each of the initial seven chapters is dedicated to an important orthodox belief, while each of the following chapters refutes a major heresy in the history of the Church from the early Christian times until the twelfth century. The text is well known to the scholars dealing with Byzantium but has remained largely unexplored because of its length and monumental tradition. This thesis represents two episodes (loosely connected) in the transmission history of the anthology. The first section situates the Panoplia in the context of early modern Europe with the publication history of the first printed edition in Greek which happened in Wallachia in 1710. The dissertation proves that this edition was initiated by the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem in relation to the proselytizing activities of the Catholics and the Protestants. The inner conflicts among the Orthodox Christians necessitated the edition and the publication was connected with the coeval Eucharistic debates, which had their origins in Western Europe but were interiorized on Orthodox soil. The second part treats one single manuscript â MS Iviron grec 281 -- which shows significant differences from the Wallachia edition and the other Panoplia manuscripts which I was able to consult. Compared to the edition, the Iviron MS omits many of the Patristic texts, but adds scholia to the fragments of Pseudo-Dionysios the Areopagite and the orations of Gregory the Theologian (Orationes 28, 29, 30, 31, 38). The present study gives a sample of these scholia: it treats the fragments of Gregory of Nazianzosâ De Theologia, Oratio 30 and In Theophania, Oratio 38 as well as the five short scholia to the Pseudo-Dionysian fragments. The sources on the scholia to the text of the Areopagite lead to Ambigua ad Thomam of Maximus the Confessor. For the rest of the scholia, I was able to identify most of them as fragments authored by Nicetas Heracleensis and Elias Cretensis, two among the most prominent commentators of the Theologian.

The regimes with concentrated power are believed to be particularly dangerous for the states with deep ethnic cleavages. This latter concern is a question of great importance for the post-Soviet region, because since the collapse of the Soviet Union some of the multi-ethnic post-Soviet states had the experience of both ethnic conflicts and concentration of power. Consequently, the main goal of this research is to determine whether power concentration encourages the escalation of ethnic conflicts. For this, I explore three mechanisms that may link the degree of power concentration with ethnic minoritiesâ mobilization against the state: identity-related state policies, electoral rules, and centralization. The empirical investigation is built on the analysis of three post-Soviet cases â Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine â based on the structured focused comparison technique. The data presented in this research reveal that the highest level of ethnic minoritiesâ mobilization against the state in the three post-Soviet republics occurred in periods with dispersed power, and not in periods with concentrated power. The research further shows that contrary to the common expectation, the reason for this was not the presumed suppressive character of concentrationist regimes over ethnic groups as citizens. Instead, the incumbent elites in the periods with power concentration combined minoritiesâ cooptation in central and local power with the enhanced control over the regional elite formation and regional access to financial resources, and in some cases, with a gradual de-politization of societal multi-ethnicity. Specifically, the leadership of concentrationist regimes tended to increase the threshold for accessing power through electoral rules with disproportional elements, which prevented the consolidation of ethnic parties and at the same time attracted minority leaders to the ruling parties. In addition, concentration of power tended to augment territorial centralization. This implied an increased control by central level political incumbents over the financial, administrative, and political affairs at regional level, which reduced local potential mobilizersâ access to mobilization resources. Finally, as the leadership of power concentration tended to implement integrationist rather than accommodationist policies towards minorities, this de-emphasized the political importance of multi-ethnicity.  The research concludes that at least in the three cases included in the analysis, concentration of power did not trigger, but it rather discouraged ethnic mobilization against the state, due to its intrinsic tendencies to increase the threshold for access to power of potential challengers and also to co-opt minority leaders, to strengthen centralization of power, and to de-politicize ethnicity. Hence, the success of concentrationist regimes in reducing minoritiesâ mobilization against the state did not consist in suppressing ethnic groups as citizens, but in hindering the formation of a self-standing ethnic minority elite. Therefore, if power concentration is to be avoided in the post-Soviet region, it should be for other reasons than for fear of ethnic instability.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (5258k),"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD,0,1

It explores agromanufacturing- from the colonial period to the present-day Kenya to show the evident underlying continuity of colonial structures and contradictions characteristic of different large-scale commercial agriculture as a strategy of national and regional development across the country. By focusing on everyday lives of the plantation labourers in the South Nyanza sugarbelt, the dissertation reveals the nature and dynamic of development generally and the large scale commercial farming economy in particular as unpredictable and chaotic. What is more significant from the findings is the demonstrated acceptance, integration and accommodation of chaos into the constitutive and operational logic of the plantation economy and its development itinerary. Throughout the dissertation, the relations between the agromanufacturing complex as a structure designed for modernization intervention and the invisible everyday lives of those in its orbit are shown to be characterized by unpredictability, contradictions, differentiations, violence, deprivations and exploitative dispossession. Combined, these make lives under such development interventions insecure, disjointed, vulnerable and disorderly. My study contributes to the sociology and social anthropology of development by proposing a fresh look at development interventions as âchaotic projectsâ which produce disorder rather than smooth solutions to technical disorder. Such a look, building on works of other such as Tania Li and James Ferguson, integrates the ideas of Foucault to show how development has in effect become a series of normalizations where more attention is focused on making things seem normal rather actually transforming them. For instance, the study shows how dispossession of land, labour and employment safeguards are part of repertoire of tactics employed to enhance efficiency and productivity in the factory though they expose the plantation workers and villagers to extreme deprivation and invisibility. Furthermore, the study responds to the significant absence of a disciplinary society approach to development related research in Africa though much of the interventions are implemented as disciplinary projects. By combining Foucaultâs conception of power and the concept of chaos in studying agromanufacturing as development in Kenya, the study shows how development is not only chaotic but sustained by chaos: under development, disorder is the order. This is the central argument in the dissertation.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2632k),ETD,Agriculture -- Economic aspects -- Kenya,,PhD,0,1

Previous comparative research emphasized the role of institutions in conditioning individualsâ behavior and attitudes. I argue that not only the institutional design, but also the quality of the political institutions in the country constrains citizensâ political attitudes, preferences, and decisions. I do this by examining how living in countries with different quality of governance affects peopleâs institutional trust,perceptions of representation and accountability, attitudes towards the welfare state, voting behavior, and election results both in an absolute sense and relative to the design of the political institutions. Doing so this dissertation builds on and contributes to the literature of comparative political behavior, contextual effects, and political institutions, and has substantive and normative implications for the study of electoral democracy. All of the empirical analyses are cross-national and employ multilevel analyses of data from Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the World Value Survey, and different indicators of the quality of governance and political institutions.  After a brief introduction, I examine the implications of various aspects of good governance on individualsâ confidence in different public and political institutions. I find that some aspects of good governance have a stronger impact on institutional trust than others, but how the institutions provide judicial and bureaucratic efficiency and control of corruption clearly makes them look more or less trustworthy. I then look at the role of the quality of governance in shaping individual preferences toward income redistribution and social welfare policies, and find that bad governance leads to a remarkable inconsistency in individualsâ preferences, preferring more extensive social benefits simultaneously with less income redistribution. I investigate further whether people feel less represented and politiciansâ less accountable under bad governance in chapter four. I find that institutional design matters more for a sense of procedural representation, while good governance is more important for substantive representation. Chapter five focuses on the link between the impact of ideology, economic evaluations and partisanship on the vote on the one hand, and corruption on the other, and the implications of cultural norms for these relationships. I find that as corruption rises, ideological considerations and sympathies towards the chief executive party weigh less in votersâ decision; and while living in a country with a strong culture of corruption does not make people adopt different voting behavior, it instills a higher likelihood of voting against the incumbent. Before concluding, I test the electoral implications of good governance for incumbentâs survival in chapter six, and find that the quality of governance is as important as the economy.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2002k),ETD,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD,0,1

Having been a womenâs organization in the Ukrainian diaspora and an ethnic organization in American and international womenâs movements from its inception, the UNWLA often considered its participation in international womenâs forums instrumental in promoting the cause of Ukraineâs sovereignty. Instead of withdrawing from this arena in the early years of Ukraineâs independence, however, the UNWLA started to adopt the womenâs rights and equality discourses for generating relations with the state and non-state actors in Ukraine and for conceptualizing a vision for the organizationâs future. Drawing on fieldwork findings from the New York City branches of the organization, I argue that the current shift in the UNWLAâs relation to womenâs rights movement has been triggered not only by the changes in the political status of their homeland, but also by the generational shift in the UNWLA membership as well as by the growing currency of womenâs rights discourses in the international politics.",Degree: PhD,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,PhD,0,1

The present PhD research aims to investigate the process and impacts of transition from public to private provision of water services in Armenia and to explore the aspects of the supply side on the level of water utility performance and the demand side on the level of end-users (households) ensuring proper consideration of social and environmental demands and legal and institutional implications. In particular, the empirical research focuses on the effects of governance modes on the sustainability performance of water utilities currently operating in Armenia under various forms of public-private partnerships. The analysis explores the directional, magnitude and evolution impacts of water privatization in Armenia along sustainability dimensions: environmental, social, and economic performance. Next, the research is focusing on the impacts of water privatization on households (water access and consumption profile, service quality, coping strategies, etc.). The research also seeks to examine the structural and process changes in the water sector as an aggregate mechanism of policies, legal and regulatory procedures, organizational structures, financing and impact mitigation mechanisms. The research is based on the mixed method approach with the application of several methodological tools. The major methodological components include ex-post benchmarking method, conversational/stakeholder interviewing, document analysis, and the household survey  bottom-up participatory approach that puts people at the core of the research. Research results show that intensive marketization trends with related structural changes reinforced privatization in public services. Conditional technical and financial support from donor institutions and urgency dictated by the deteriorating infrastructure made privatization a âno other optionâ. Even under the âforcedâ conditions, transition to the public-private provision of water services in Armenia had a positive influence on the sustainability performance of all water utilities. Armenian utilities also succeed in performing well internationally. However, the scale of impact of privatization depends on the initial state of the enterprise and the local context. Supportive legislation and regulation is needed for ensuring the attractiveness and incentives for the private sector participation and operation and for protecting consumers from monopoly abuse. Furthermore, although water supply services have been improved and people are generally satisfied with water services, there are still a number of service deficiencies that households face and try to cope with by implementing a number of measures that require additional costs and/or behavioural changes. Finally, after the high return and low risk low hanging fruits are reached during the first generation reforms to meet the most urgent needs, more efforts are required for enhancing long-term sustainability and effectiveness.",Water supply -- Armenia,,PhD,0,1

On the other hand, the enhanced self-consciousness or even pride of the Renaissance author compared to that of the earlier medieval one is a long established commonplace; indeed, humanist poets were inclined, in varying degrees, to self-fashioning, self-mythologizing. My interdisciplinary study focuses on the junction of these two basic habits of mind of German humanists around 1500. I reveal solar and astral (mainly astrological) symbolism in Neo-Latin poetical works and visual artworks of this period, and investigate how this cosmic symbolism was used for self-representative purposes. Among the German humanists I focus on Conrad Celtis (1459-1508), the ââarch-humanistâ of Germany, the first poet laureate of his nation, the ""bringer of the muses"" to the German land. Celtis's personality, poetic talent, ambition, scientific-philosophical interests, his assumed role â all this resulted in various interesting ways of ""cosmic"" self-representation; I argue that this is a core area of his whole poetical oeuvre. In the investigated period of German humanism (c. 1485-1510), some other poets who were friends of Celtis also employed astronomical, astrological, cosmological imagery in the construction of their (or the group's) humanist identities, in various ways, to various extent: Jakob Locher, Laurentius Corvinus (Rabe), Johannes Tolhopf, Augustinus Moravus; I involve in my research representative works of these authors, too. The first chapter reviews the poetological background of the enhanced vates-ideology of the German humanists: the humanist revaluation of poetry in the Renaissance and the ââdefense of poetryâ tradition. The second chapter overviews Celtisâs ideas about astronomy-astrology, micro- and macrocosm in general. Chapters 3-6 explore Celtisâs and his firendsâ strategies of ââcosmicâ self-representation through analyses of specific works. Humanists could support their vates-role by means of their (idealized) birth horoscope or the horoscope of laureation (ch. 3-4); or they could develop a complex Phoebean symbolism based on Phoebus, the solar god who supports the poet in various ways (ch. 5). Humanist group-identity could be strengthened through a Phoebean-Bacchic symbolism and the mythologizing of humanist feasts (ch. 6).",Degree: PhD,PDF file (9848k),ETD,Unrestricted,,,PhD,0,1

Such general process, defined by a departure from exclusively institutional religious worldviews towards more diverse ones, is in tune with what occurs at the latin american/regional and local levels; and yet at the same time itâs also far from being homogeneous to all social realities in which it takes place, as the Peruvian case provides also with examples. Given this contrasting relationship between the local and the global, it is worth questioning as to what is the cause (or causes) attributable for these shared differences in form, but not in content. In the present thesis, I will address this question in arguing that religious socialization experiences, in the form of Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs onwards), are one of the main conditioners for shaping contemporary Peruvian religious and secular worldviews. CREDs are related to instances of observable behavior from an individualâs peers that generate an impact on them, based on how they act accordingly to what is stipulated in their respective religious belief systems or expressed religious convictions. In turn and over time, different CREDs will allow for the acquisition, maintenance or relegation of religious belief and their negotiations, which give rise to diversified worldviews.  For this purpose, I have placed as unit of analysis the age group of Peruvian young adults, (18-29 y.o.) all of them being university students located in Lima-Peru, since, as it will be argued, Peruvian youth within this age group experiences religious socialization in differentiated ways to previous generations, namely, in their general socialization experiences; in the accessing of novel media elements; in the engagement of social movements; and, in the adoption of a consumer ethos.  An interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological approach will be the basis for the elaboration of the argument, in which concepts from the fields of Cognitive Science of Religion and Sociology (in the form of theories of religious socialization) will serve as analytical tools; while grounded techniques based on Q-methodology have been used for the data gathering process of 320 surveys, 43 q-sorts, and 43 structured interviews. As a result of this exploration, a preliminary proposal of ideal-type models of religious and secular worldviews will be outlined.

While current labor studies focus mostly on the impact of neoliberalization on labor, this thesis demonstrates that experiences of workers, engaged in cultural production in authoritarian states, are conditioned by the stateâs endeavor at reproduction of symbolic order and marginalization of those in conflict with the hegemonic state project as well. For this reason, labor of journalists under authoritarian neoliberal regime is characterized as âpoliticallyâ and âeconomicallyâ precarious, and these two dimensions of precarity are closely intertwined. Journalists simultaneously face lack of stable contracts, employment insecurity, menace of media outlets being shut-down and even life threat. This research discusses how independent journalists in Russia experience and articulate these insecurities, related to specific economic and political contexts in which their labor is placed. The thesis demonstrates that political dimension of precarity, engendered by the authoritarian regime, is treated by journalists as the most problematic, whereas economic insecurities, albeit solidly present, tend to be ignored. Among the reasons for non- acknowledgement of the economic dimension of precarity are specific understanding of labor journalists share, their liberal ideologies, strong affective bindings to a job, widespread among cultural workers, and privileged class positions.

Out of several branches of law affected by this concept, the research will focus primarily on structuring, i.e. on the choices of corporate vehicles for business operations and legal consequences that such choices brings with them. In addition, special attention will be paid to tax considerations of such options as they by default heavily affect both the choice of business vehicles and operations of private equity industry in general. The primary reason for making such analysis lies in the fact that up to date scholarly works on legal aspects of private equity in Serbia are essentially descriptive. They do not give the answer as to why private equity industry in the country has not made a substantial progress for more than a decade after its regulation. Nor do they establish a comparative model upon which the industry can look upon. In this research, it is suggested that the US system may serve as such model. For these purposes, it explores the characteristics of the US system and the options it offers. The thesis will conclude that having a choice between several business vehicles and tax treatments is beneficial for the development of private equity industry in a country. Notably, the system needs to provide the possibility for private equity funds and firms to operate as flexible entities that are also fiscally transparent. This conclusion outlines the need for the developing countries to constantly reexamine their approach when it comes to the legal treatment of private equity. Overall, the research shows that civil law systems have many lessons to adopt from the American experience with the regulation of private equity industry. Out of it also comes the recommendation for future scholarly works on alternative models for the development of the industry in Serbia.",Degree: MA,PDF file (785k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

This research is answering the question why, despite the existing legacy of federative relations with the substantial level of decentralization and accountability with democratic traditions German regions does not show good budgetary performance, whereas in the absence of historical legacy and accountability mechanisms and with the high level of political centralization in Russia, it is possible to create system with the better budgetary performance. The hypothesis of this research was that indeed, the historical heritage and democratic rules increase the level of decentralization and accountability, but this does not necessarily lead to better budgetary performance because of the weak budgetary constraints and incentives. The results of this study approve this hypothesis. Tested by crisp-set Qualitative Comparative analysis this research shows several important tendencies. Despite of the historical roots, federal legacy and democratic type of regime leading to a greater level of decentralization, budgetary performance is not a direct consequence of such a system. With a relatively high level of decentralization, many of Germany's decentralization mechanisms work towards a worse performance. In particular, a strong level of fiscal decentralization, a lack of transparent budgetary allocation mechanisms (which are mainly related to the type of parliamentary political system), and a large number of equalizing federal transfers together with an uncontrolled regional opportunity to borrow money lead to a worse budgetary performance in that country. On the other hand, a more centralized system with lower level of accountability more often shows the better results in terms of budgetary performance, although some centralization tendencies (primarily political ones) do not contribute to the best level of budgetary indicators. Thus, the main conclusion of this work that hard budget constraints together with transparent responsibilities division allow a higher level of budgetary performance in Russia and Germany. These findings contribute to the literature on political economy of federal systems.",,PDF file (987k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

It is demonstrated that identifying the key premise of Duginâs approach to political philosophy as the insistence on the ontological primacy of community in relation to the construction of the human self, envisioned in Heideggerian terms, allows for Duginâs political application of Heideggerâs fundamental ontology to be both sufficiently distinct from present currents in political thought, and flexible to be appropriated as a new conceptual foundation by a wide array of radical conservative and right-wing movements.",,PDF file (884k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

The common feature of political science literature related to a social network is that they mostly focus on whether the individualsâ political views and their social networks co-evolve or not. According to the recent literature, social networks do not simply evolve but also stimulate our political behavior. Most of the literature finds that people seek individuals with similar political views to be friends with and individuals who often talk to each other tend to be more similar over time Although there is broad agreement on that while our social network is dynamically flourishing, it is also affecting our attitude, but the process of this impact is still not clear. This research aims to examine the channel between social affiliations to the changes of political behavior. The research uses network data collected from experiments to specify the social affiliation effects on the change of political views under a deliberation process.

With the changes in policies of immigration and skill development, it has also become important to analyze migrants' perception of skills and their strategies of adapting further skills to be employed on high-skill jobs. The purpose of the dissertation is about investigating the integration of migrants into EU labor markets.

I argue that this is an oversimplification. Knowledge can be partially rival and excludable, and companies routinely use secrecy to mitigate the risk of knowledge disclosure. The path of an invention from an inventor to general knowledge is far from straightforward, influenced by many factors including institutional interventions such as patents. I introduce a new property of permanencyâthe inability to reverse transactions with a goodâto analyze how knowledge becomes a public good. To show the effects of permanency empirically, I use assignment data on over four million US patents to test the hypothesis that patents on relatively less reverse-engineerable inventions will more likely be reassigned sooner after the application date. The results of a logistic and survival regression support this hypothesis, which suggests that permanency plays a role in motivations of inventors and companies to patent. Future research on knowledge creation and disclosure and policy proposals for patent reforms thus should employ a more nuanced conceptualization of knowledge, in which permanency plays a role.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1563k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

Furthermore, significant barriers to the growth of solar off-grid systems are policy loopholes, unmet demands of consumers, consumerâs affordability, and lack of financing options.

Without improvement, some of the rules are nothing more than just providing the opportunity for the state of claiming the completion of one of its international obligations. In order for the protection orders effectively to fulfil their mission, states, officials of law enforcement authorities and even ordinary citizens must realize the deep-rooted nature of violence against women. Therefore, not only the rules and the practice of the authorities should be improved, but peopleâs mindset also has to be altered for attaining the objectives pursued.

The crisis had resulted in the intensification of the migration discourse that was never seen before in the country. A part of this intensification was a strong state campaign that has been built on the crisis: a nationalist and hegemonic rhetoric which was rejective and hostile towards migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. This propaganda spoke about migratory processes in the framework of securitization where the process was understood and mobilized as a threat to the European-Christian culture. This narrative was not only rhetorically but visually outstanding. State financed posters and advertisements represented âthe migrantâ as a voiceless, faceless, male, violent, dark-skinned person who is not even an individual but exists in a horde-like group of people. Besides of this xenophobic and hostile context, counter-hegemonic narratives emerged not just in the form of social movements but, as I argue, in the artistic-visual field too. In my thesis, I focus on this contemporary counter-discourse of the Hungarian cinema through the lenses of three movies which have a privileged position in the âmigration movieâ corpus in Hungary, not only because all of them was funded by the state but because they earned nationwide recognition. These movies are The Citizen (2016), Jupiterâs Moon (2017) and Easy Lessons (2018). The first part of my research would like to contextualize these movies with special regard to their socio-political and cultural context. For this, I carry out discourse analysis on the already existing literature. After, I make the analysis of the movies themselves to explore the place of them in the discourse on visual representation and migration after 2015. The main questions of the analysis are how these movies are the part of the counter-discourse, what are those circumstances by the dominant state discourse that could challenge free artistic expression, and in which ways aesthetic and political elements are intertwined in the visual language of these movies. The research would like to answer these questions through the politics of (in)visibility and those artistic instruments that aim to transform the unseen âOtherâ into visible. Therefore the thesis displays two competing visual attitudes towards the representation of migration: one by the neo-authoritarian state propaganda and another by the contemporary Hungarian cinema.",Degree: MA,PDF file (430k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

Within the framework composed of these four dimension, I examine the production politics in the courier sector and conclude that: first, as a result of the fierce market competition, intention to lower the labour cost and the characteristics of the work itself, the courier worker is organized by the capital both as an employee and a contractor, which indicated the tension of lose labour control and intensified labour control ; secondly, the first point may contribute to the discussion of the separation of execution and conception work in an informal work sector; thirdly, such a concept indicates a self-motivated and self-responsible ideology; fourthly, the stateâs public governance may have a direct impact on the workerâs condition, so as to the factory regime.

These ideas are rehearsed against the theoretical backdrop of Leo Bersaniâs and Lee Edelmanâs antirelational queer theory, JosÃ© Estaban MuÃ±ozâs work on queer potentiality, relationality and hope as articulated in Cruising Utopia in opposition to antiutopian antirelationality, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwickâs affective turn (in particular her theorizing on shame and her concept of paranoid and reparative reading). The analyses in the first two chapters gesture toward a displacement of antirelational queer theoryâs overinvestment in the radicality of strategically embracing cultural fantasies of male homosexuality as psychic negativity or erotic self-annihiliation. In contrast to these tropes, a vision of queer relationality grounded in the relational dynamics of shame is forwarded, drawing on Sedgwickâs work on shame inspired by Silvan Tomkinsâs affect theory. The shy queer man thus comes to figure as a counterpoint to the death-driven queer subject enraptured by jouissance. The third chapter, in turn, moves from such a contrastive âanti-antirelationalâ engagement to a closer exploration of Tomkinsâs theory of shame, combining it with phenomenological film theory and Sara Ahmedâs work on queer phenomenology, arguing that the short filmâs climactic moment allows us to think shame as utopian potentiality as conceived by MuÃ±oz. Finally, the conclusion suggests a conception of shame as reparative affect in contrast to routinized habits of thought in paranoid antirelational queer theory.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

The first one that I refer to as the Christian argument is found in the discourse of Viktor Orban who opposes Islam based on its supposed incompatibility with traditional Christian values. On the other hand, secular argument that Wilders uses is based on the commitment to secular ideas and perception that Islam is incompatible with Western liberal values. In conclusion, I will try to answer the more ambitious question: how the anti-immigrant mobilization affects European solidarity and identification with Europe as the common culture? The aim to show that advocates of civilizationist arguments are interpreting those threats as the potential danger primarily to European collective identity, which is contained within their separate national identities.

Based on low wages and low taxes, the countryâs political economy mitigates against the emergence of Ð° âbroad middleâ habitually associated with the developed welfare states of the West. 80% of the working population ekes out less than 500 EUR monthly, making Bulgaria the poorest EU-member state. After three decades of neoliberal reforms, the countryâs class structure resembles that of a Third world country: a tiny opulent minority sits atop a vast ocean of poverty. The unpopularity of this mode of economic development prompted the liberal ideologues of the Transition to create a social base for the liberal reforms in the early 2000s, a project that culminated with the 2013 anti-corruption protests. Therefore, I analyze the insurgent âmiddle classâ as a political, rather than economic formation. More specifically, I explore the formation of the Bulgarian middle class from the vantage point of the 2013 summer protests. That year saw feverish protest mobilizations in two phases in winter and summer. Even though these protests occupy determinate temporal frames, their significance reverberates to this day because commentators continue to make sense of current events through the prism of the âlong 2013.â  Time and again pundits and participants stated that the summer protests portended the birth of the middle class. I follow these discussions in the public sphere and tease out the vectors of inclusion into the self-identified middle class.  The first part of the thesis focuses on class formation and class consciousness where class is understood in materialist yet non-economistic terms. I offer a way of thinking about the problem of the âmiddle classâ that breaks with the double objectivism of structural and mechanical theories extrapolating its existence from the laws of capital in Orthodox Marxism, on the one hand, and from liberal stratification theories which rely on arbitrary income brackets to discern its existence, on the other. Because of the strong emphasis on class polarization, inherited from the Manifesto, the âmiddle classâ has traditionally posed a challenge Marxists have tended to overcome via a recourse to Weberian âprostheticsâ.  In contrast, I treat class as a political becoming, every class is always-already a âclass againstâ. Thus, a âsubjectivistâ approach to social class is well suited to understand this formation. To this end, I fashion a theoretical apparatus out of Pierre Bourdieuâs sociology and the Essex Schoolâs Discourse Theory to account for the discursive and polemical constitution of the middle class of the 2013 summer protests. This theoretical amalgam offers a polemical slant to theorizing class formation, resonating with some early remarks on the political nature of social class by Karl Marx.  I do so against the backdrop of the thorny path of the neoliberal reform in Bulgaria. I argue that the middle class is the crystallization of a long search on part of policy elites, civil society practitioners and democratization experts to find the âsocial baseâ for the neoliberal reform, perceived as increasingly beleaguered by populism, left and right.  One such challenge to the reform consensus came in the wake of the winter protest of 2013. It rebelled against austerity, poverty and the political establishment, yet it did so by poaching the liberal semantic field and appropriating the language of âcivil societyâ. The summer protests re-appropriated the appropriation and, in the process, subjectivized itself as âmiddle classâ against the winter protests and the corrupt oligarchic elite.  The second part of the thesis traces the effects the 2013 class imaginaries exert on the formal and universalistic political equality under liberalism. The discourse of âthe middle classâ organized the protestersâ normative visions about citizenship and national identity along increasingly inegalitarian, demophobic and elitist lines.  This dissertation thus follows an instance of âclass struggleâ unfolding on the terrains of civil society, citizenship and nationhood. I show how the radicalization of imaginaries about class difference are projected onto the political field resulting in a tendency to question formal equality under liberalism.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (4468k),ETD,Middle class -- Bulgaria,,PhD,0,1

The research reconstructs debates and dialogues between progressive clergy and radical religious intelligentsia following the massacre of Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905. The dissertation interprets the visions that emerged in the network of the Orthodox left in the framework of âpolitical theologiesâ. It focuses on three programs and their theo-political language: the Brotherhood of Zealots for Church Renovation; the Christian Brotherhood of Struggle; and the Union of Christian Politics. Members argued that the mutually dependent relationship between the tsar and the people, which served as a political bedrock for the Empire for centuries, was now beyond repair. The bloodshed was perceived as a fundamental break in Russian Orthodox political theory, and the horrible events inspired religious intelligentsia and progressive clergy to theorise about politics and social justice as Orthodox believers. The dissertation identifies the concept of Christian obshchestvennostâ (sociality) as the focal point of all programs that emerged among advocates of the Orthodox left in the period. The concept had palingenetic power, it was meant to reinvigorate the Church and to re-Christianise the whole of fin de siÃ¨cle Russian society.

In this regard a growing field of interest is the quantification of PA ecological effectiveness, often expressed in terms of avoided deforestation achieved relative to unprotected areas. However, such assessments are confounded by biases in both the non-random siting of PAs within landscapes as well as differential pressure upon their resources. These biases can be overcome by the use of quasi-experimental counterfactual study designs, that evaluate the impact of PAs against control areas of âsimilarâ biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. To contribute towards this knowledge domain this study presents an assessment of PA effectiveness for the Southeast Asian nation Cambodia, which, in light of its history of natural resource management, represents a pertinent case study. PA effectiveness was analysed using propensity score matching for three different outcome periods between 2010-2018 with the results finding significant positive treatment effects in each, with forested land in PAs being as much as 8% less likely to be deforested than similar unprotected forest. In addition to this a significant positive spillover effect of PAs was observed in 5km buffers zones adjacent to their boundaries, resulting in a maximum of 4% reduction in probability of deforestation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of PAs in Cambodia was found to vary under differential deforestation pressure as well as with regards to the duration of time since PA establishment.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (6599k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

Labor shortages and brain drain are becoming an obstacle to economic development and the region is failing to reach growth rates that would bring it closer to European Union countries. In order to get out of this stalemate, a radical turn is needed, both in terms of initiative for change and in terms of solutions. With the lack of interest of European Union for the region, it is up to countries of the region to take the initiative.

Time as a resource, reflecting the power relations, is distributed unequally within the groups of people, with some spending most of the time working to ensure survival, while others are enjoying vast amounts of discretionary time. In contemporary society, the lack of time is especially acute in the lives of working mothers. The persistent essentialist understanding of motherhood still requires women to devote most of their time beyond paid employment to caregiving, and the standard working hours not taking the time needed for care responsibilities into account. This thesis explores the time poverty experienced by working mothers in Georgia who, due to unregulated working hours and the demands of motherhood, enjoy little to no temporal autonomy. The aim of the research is to analyze the perceptions of time for them and study the ways in which they distribute their time between paid labor, unpaid labor, and leisure and the reasoning behind this arrangement. I argue that the perception of time for working mothers in Georgia, shaped by the essentialist understanding of motherhood, is malleable and adaptable to immediate circumstances, different from the rigidity of capitalist temporality. The data collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews suggest that women perceive time poverty as their individual problem instead of questioning structural inequality leading to this condition; respondents assume that they have more control over their time than they actually do. Over the years, they have adopted different time management and time-saving strategies in order to utilize their time beyond paid employment and meet the contradictory standards of a good employee and a good mother. For this, they often have to juggle several tasks at a time, seek paid or unpaid help from other females, sacrifice their professional growth and leisure time, and put extensive effort into scheduling every minute of their days.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

It is an enormous task to project an accurate figure for the number of unaccompanied children seeking asylum as the numbers are not quite consistent. There is no real data despite the existence of several monitoring systems that are presently in place. Many unaccompanied children have disappeared whilst navigating their way across various geographic terrains as they flee persecution in their country of origin, predominantly as a result of conflict. Resultantly, some cross borders in search of their parents, while others become victims of child trafficking. This study centres on a comparative analysis of the rights of UMs in the United Kingdom(UK) and France and is done via the vantage point of migration and asylum processes. The study contributes to the discussion regarding the compliance of states on the primary consideration for the best interests of the child, presenting a prescriptive view in reviewing the application of the CRC and the EU acquis. This is carefully done taking into account the asylum laws and procedures of the State and the EU into account. This study, while analysing the implementation of the best interests of the child, tries to understand in whose best interests are policies and laws are created - the state or the child. The thesis concludes with the summation of reasons of noncompliance with the CRC recommendations, and the infringement of the principle rights of the child during age assessment procedures.

Despite the recent legislative developments, the regulation of franchise in Ethiopia is far from being adequate, in particular, it fails to provide a clear regulatory framework and is unable to respond to the existing franchise abuses in Ethiopia. These defects result in lots of uncertainties that will inevitably negatively affect entrepreneurship and the emergence of a viable strong local franchise industry as well as be an obstacle in attracting foreign franchisors which could contribute to the countryâs economy. The aim of this thesis is to critically assess the protection of franchisees in Ethiopia as one of the cornerstones of modern business format franchise by analyzing the recent Ethiopian legislative developments aimed at promoting the business model in light of global and local trends as well as the experiences of selected jurisdictions. The comparison will extend to three countriesâ laws and experiences. The United States is chosen because of its rich experience in franchise regulation as it is the origin of the business model itself. Hungary was chosen because it represents the other spectrum of the regulation with more historical similarity with Ethiopia and economic proximity in comparison with other European countries and additionally because of similarity in the regulation and protection of franchisees.

It illuminates on how these value chains span beyond digital labour market UpWork and are built on the local relations within Serbian freelance network. The main question of the thesis is how the organization of production specific to UpWork, as well as locally conditioned market positions and structural differences of freelancers, shape the relations within this network. Firstly, I analyse how the value chains span into the network through re-outsourcing of work between freelancers and enable value capture for individual freelancers. Those who outsource act as suppliers in the value chains and depend on trust relations with their subcontractors, while those subcontractors who are in weak structural positions both on the platform and domestic labour market depend on them for access to jobs and platform reputation. Secondly, I show how the network is utilized for learning, as well as social and emotional support. As freelancers act as fragmented suppliers of which majority is in extremely precarious positions and acts mostly as a labour reserve army, these processes are needed for their further engagement in the market. Furthermore, due to structural constraints, this network lacks capacities for political organization and it serves primarily individuals to compete within these value chains. Thus, the processes of value creation and capture, learning and cooperation, as well as relational work, which are regularly integrated into firm value chains, are in the case of platform outsourcing dispersed and decentralized throughout the freelance networks constructed from the bottom-up.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1015k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1

The three-level analysis of Indiaâs foreign policy from 2001 to 2018, shows that India is taking different pathways depending on the level and realm of geopolitical scope. I argue that India is a polyvalent rising power, demonstrating that India pursued a reactive behavior at the local (South Asia) level, at the regional (Indian Ocean Region) level it was characterized by its engagement, while at the global level its role was active.

By enforcing the stateÃ¢â¬â¢s monopoly on armed forces and integrating political opponents, these mechanisms hold a promising potential towards the reconstruct war-torn nations. In 2016, the government of Colombia reached an historic peace deal with the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) guerrilla, thus ending the longest lasting civil war in the Americas. After more than 50 years of civil war, in which hundreds of thousands were killed and millions displaced, the implementation of DDR started. Now in its third year, the implementation is slow, uneven and is encountering several difficulties. In August 2019, some ex-FARC leaders called for the return of an armed insurgency, citing the failures of the Colombian government in implementing the Peace Agreement. As mitigated results of the DDR in Colombia emerge, an overall assessment is valuable.

At the same time, Israel â a country with a climate similar to that of Cape Town â was also experiencing severe drought. In contrast, Israel showed the exact opposite trend, achieving water security despite these adverse conditions. This paper therefore aims to understand why the water security outcomes for these two regions were so different, given the similar circumstances. The method used for conducting the research is a comparative analysis, examining the threats to water security that both regions face, and how water security is approached. Findings showed that there are several reasons for the differing outcomes. Cape Town faced several challenges that Israel did not, such as the Apartheid and severe poverty; however, it seems that the challenges Israel did face -- such as large immigration waves and settling the desert made Israelâs water sector more resilient overall. This was thanks to the development of management practices such as supply augmentation via large-scale seawater desalination, utilizing treated wastewater, developing efficient agriculture technologies. Cape Townâs water management practices are far less comprehensive and developed. Additional findings show that Israel has prepared for climate change better than CoCT, a practice that may have influenced preparedness for surviving the drought.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (3733k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,0,1
