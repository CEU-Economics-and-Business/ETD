These ideas are rehearsed against the theoretical backdrop of Leo Bersani’s and Lee Edelman’s antirelational queer theory, José Estaban Muñoz’s work on queer potentiality, relationality and hope as articulated in Cruising Utopia in opposition to antiutopian antirelationality, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s affective turn (in particular her theorizing on shame and her concept of paranoid and reparative reading). The analyses in the first two chapters gesture toward a displacement of antirelational queer theory’s overinvestment in the radicality of strategically embracing cultural fantasies of male homosexuality as psychic negativity or erotic self-annihiliation. In contrast to these tropes, a vision of queer relationality grounded in the relational dynamics of shame is forwarded, drawing on Sedgwick’s work on shame inspired by Silvan Tomkins’s affect theory. The shy queer man thus comes to figure as a counterpoint to the death-driven queer subject enraptured by jouissance. The third chapter, in turn, moves from such a contrastive “anti-antirelational” engagement to a closer exploration of Tomkins’s theory of shame, combining it with phenomenological film theory and Sara Ahmed’s work on queer phenomenology, arguing that the short film’s climactic moment allows us to think shame as utopian potentiality as conceived by Muñoz. Finally, the conclusion suggests a conception of shame as reparative affect in contrast to routinized habits of thought in paranoid antirelational queer theory.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The present work addresses this controversy by bringing the deterrence effect and the political selection effect that the predominant principalagent- theory based literature suggests to an empirical test in the critical case of Romania. This is done by assessing the impact of National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) prosecution in two forms – the announcement of investigations and the announcement of the final sentence – on favouritism in local public procurement.

However, the effects of that phenomenon around the issue of climate change among the public on the EU energy policy remain under-researched. In order to establish the link between the two, the thesis applies the neofunctionalist EU integration framework, which claims that politicization of an issue leads to further policy integration of that topic. Previous research has noted that politicization of climate change has been underway in individual countries, however, the current thesis establishes, based on opinion polls and European Parliament election results, that this process has also occurred in the EU as all three criteria of politicization (increase in the salience, polarization of opinion and mobilization of public opinion) have increased over the last few years. Regarding energy policy, the thesis demonstrates that the deepening of energy policy integration has increased significantly, especially in the form of bottom-up pressure, thereby ’bringing politics’ into energy policy. Based on the neofunctionalist conceptual frame, the thesis concludes that the increased politicization of climate change among the public has fueled energy policy integration in the EU, becoming the main driver behind it and replacing thus the earlier driver of the Energy Union – energy security.

I argue that this is an oversimplification. Knowledge can be partially rival and excludable, and companies routinely use secrecy to mitigate the risk of knowledge disclosure. The path of an invention from an inventor to general knowledge is far from straightforward, influenced by many factors including institutional interventions such as patents. I introduce a new property of permanency—the inability to reverse transactions with a good—to analyze how knowledge becomes a public good. To show the effects of permanency empirically, I use assignment data on over four million US patents to test the hypothesis that patents on relatively less reverse-engineerable inventions will more likely be reassigned sooner after the application date. The results of a logistic and survival regression support this hypothesis, which suggests that permanency plays a role in motivations of inventors and companies to patent. Future research on knowledge creation and disclosure and policy proposals for patent reforms thus should employ a more nuanced conceptualization of knowledge, in which permanency plays a role.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1563k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

Protection of shareholders` rights through derivative instrument also exists in most European countries, however with some differences, such as `lawsuit admission procedure` in Germany. Nowadays, there is a rapid development of corporate governance in Kazakhstan which requires, as a priority, the activation of the responsibility mechanism of directors and, subsequently, the protection of shareholders' rights from the unfair activities of directors.

This research is answering the question why, despite the existing legacy of federative relations with the substantial level of decentralization and accountability with democratic traditions German regions does not show good budgetary performance, whereas in the absence of historical legacy and accountability mechanisms and with the high level of political centralization in Russia, it is possible to create system with the better budgetary performance. The hypothesis of this research was that indeed, the historical heritage and democratic rules increase the level of decentralization and accountability, but this does not necessarily lead to better budgetary performance because of the weak budgetary constraints and incentives. The results of this study approve this hypothesis. Tested by crisp-set Qualitative Comparative analysis this research shows several important tendencies. Despite of the historical roots, federal legacy and democratic type of regime leading to a greater level of decentralization, budgetary performance is not a direct consequence of such a system. With a relatively high level of decentralization, many of Germany's decentralization mechanisms work towards a worse performance. In particular, a strong level of fiscal decentralization, a lack of transparent budgetary allocation mechanisms (which are mainly related to the type of parliamentary political system), and a large number of equalizing federal transfers together with an uncontrolled regional opportunity to borrow money lead to a worse budgetary performance in that country. On the other hand, a more centralized system with lower level of accountability more often shows the better results in terms of budgetary performance, although some centralization tendencies (primarily political ones) do not contribute to the best level of budgetary indicators. Thus, the main conclusion of this work that hard budget constraints together with transparent responsibilities division allow a higher level of budgetary performance in Russia and Germany.

The state border between Belarus and Lithuania, in many of its parts inhabited by Polish population from both sides, constitutes a distinctive example of a restricted geopolitical border – the external one of the EU – that replaced clearly formal and not corresponding to any existed cultural division – yet not inconsequential – administrative line from the Soviet times. The local effect of the state-work in the production of estrangement is examined in the thesis, as well as the circulating notions of the meaning(lessness) of the border. One scrutinised dimension of this process is the emotional experience of the factual separation, established by restrictive visa regimes and border control. On the other hand, emotional modalities, through which personal experiences of the divide are expressed, are tightly interconnected with ‘the sense of border’ at its ideational level. This, in turn, leads to further exploration of the dynamics of the popular conceptualisation of the emerged difference, expressed through the vocabulary of ‘civilizational’ and geopolitical meanings produced by the states and utilised by popular political imagination.

Firstly, I analyse how the value chains span into the network through re-outsourcing of work between freelancers and enable value capture for individual freelancers. Those who outsource act as suppliers in the value chains and depend on trust relations with their subcontractors, while those subcontractors who are in weak structural positions both on the platform and domestic labour market depend on them for access to jobs and platform reputation. Secondly, I show how the network is utilized for learning, as well as social and emotional support. As freelancers act as fragmented suppliers of which majority is in extremely precarious positions and acts mostly as a labour reserve army, these processes are needed for their further engagement in the market. Furthermore, due to structural constraints, this network lacks capacities for political organization and it serves primarily individuals to compete within these value chains. Thus, the processes of value creation and capture, learning and cooperation, as well as relational work, which are regularly integrated into firm value chains, are in the case of platform outsourcing dispersed and decentralized throughout the freelance networks constructed from the bottom-up.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1015k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The common feature of political science literature related to a social network is that they mostly focus on whether the individuals’ political views and their social networks co-evolve or not. According to the recent literature, social networks do not simply evolve but also stimulate our political behavior. Most of the literature finds that people seek individuals with similar political views to be friends with and individuals who often talk to each other tend to be more similar over time Although there is broad agreement on that while our social network is dynamically flourishing, it is also affecting our attitude, but the process of this impact is still not clear.

Research focuses on the practice and jurisprudence of the regional human rights bodies (namely, the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) in addressing and combating harmful gender-based stereotypes. The aim of this comparative analysis is to answer which regional actor went the furthest in addressing and contesting gender-based stereotypes in general, particularly those that are prevalent in rape cases. Also, establishing their ‘best practices’ is important because such practice can be useful to states which are not successful in fulfilling their international and regional obligations in this specific field. My personal contribution to this topic comprises of detailed and critical assessment of the de iure and de facto situation regarding sexual violence in Croatia. If analysis shows that there are some deficiencies in domestic (Croatian) legislation and/or institutional practice, then those international standards and developments can be used as useful guidance in order to eliminate them.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1611k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The most recent milestone in political theory and practice, with regards to religion, was achieved during the 17th century i.e. secularism. However, after the recent religious resurgence in public and political affairs throughout the world, the issue of regulating religion has reemerged as a challenge to contemporary liberal democracies. Therefore, the puzzle that liberalism’s basic architecture and secularism as a basic pillar of achieving religious toleration were specifically solutions to specific provincial (European) issues, increases the salience of religion today and demands a reevaluation of the basic tenets of this debate. This thesis argues, that due to certain blind spots in Liberal Political Thought’s (LPT) understanding of religion, LPT’s secularism promises to uphold liberal neutrality (neutrality of the state towards ethical conceptions) universally, however, secularism, due to its Christian-inflicted history and origins, requires a reconceptualization in order to uphold the ideal of liberal neutrality.",,PDF file (501k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

With governments struggling in addressing major global issues, society is now increasingly calling in the private sector to do so by asking for companies to promote positive social change. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) embodies this new position of business in society and makes corporations no longer mere objects of regulation but rather political actors themselves involved in the definition and establishment of rules and norms. The scope of this thesis is to investigate nature and scale of MNCs’ political authority in the international system through the analysis of the CSR regime to provide for a better understanding of these new forms of governance. Yet, for this to be possible, a context-specific study of power is needed. Following a power analysis in which different power considerations are connected to different possible reasons for MNCs’ compliance with socially-responsible policies, CSR is here interpreted as a system of self-discipline and conformity from which MNCs result being both empowered and constrained. CSR – a by-product of the broader neoliberal regime of governmentality – by redefining the boundaries between public and private, invests firms with political authority while at the same time reinventing their social role in a way that the resulting system of governance ultimately both governs through and consists of the very success of its discourse in the global economy.",Degree: MA,PDF file (682k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The proposal is viewed as part of an expanding array of mechanisms aimed at guaranteeing victims rights. I ground the proposal in an understanding of the goals of transitional justice, and the alternative measures available to meet these goals. Coming to a final verdict in an international criminal trial is an important step toward meeting transitional justice goals including the utilitarian and retributive goals achieved through ruling on liability, and symbolic justice for victims. In general, trial in absentia is viewed as acceptable by international and regional human rights courts if safeguards are met. Different international tribunals have approached trial in absentia with varying degrees of tolerance. This thesis examines international and regional standards surrounding trial in absentia, including case-law from the Human Rights Committee (HRC), International Criminal Court (ICC), International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and concludes that partial in absentia trials will likely continue to be permitted in international law. This thesis devotes a separate chapter to analysis of trial in absentia at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the Statutes of which explicitly allow for proceedings in the absence of the defendant. Despite the strong tradition dictating that a trial should end upon the death of defendant, legal theory and precedent shows that international criminal law allows for some procedural flexibility in favor victim’s rights, due to the gravity of international core crimes and the sui generis nature of international tribunals. In order to establish guidelines surrounding when flexibility can occur, this thesis examines international law in the frame of Packer’s two models, as well as the work of Damaska and Megrét, and case-law from the European Court of Human Rights. The thesis concludes by examining how trial in absentia—usually resulting from the flight of the defendant, the defendant’s refusal to appear at his or her trial, the defendant’s disruption of the courtroom, or serious medical needs of the defendant—can apply to cases where the defendant has died, without violating human rights norms. This thesis ultimately advocates for the adoption of a waiver system in which the defendant may agree to the continuation of his or her trial after death.",Degree: MA,PDF file (666k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

What were the migration-related issues encountered by the women in dealing with the Philippine and Hungarian governments? What are the challenges of living and working in Hungary, and how do Filipina migrant workers address them? How does identity figure in these challenges and the women’s responses to them? In making the above inquiries, the thesis not only broadens the discussion on Filipinas employed abroad in terms of occupation and geographical location, but also challenges essentialist narratives in existing literature on women OFWs. The research was enriched by drawing on the accounts of ten women OFWs in Hungary of different ages, civil status, occupations, and socio-economic backgrounds, with a view to find out as much as possible about their motivations and aspirations. This is important because studies or articles on women OFWs need to account for diverse jobs, personalities, individual circumstances leading to migration, and lived experiences that go beyond abuse, exploitation, or violence to have a fuller view of the women’s complexities.  In order to analyze the information gathered from the women interviewees, a Feminist Global Political Economy (GPE) framework was used. This framework utilizes the feminist perspective to examine the situation of the women OFWs within the global political economy, which involves different actors and elaborate domestic-international, private-public, local-global, and south-north interactions. Concepts from intersectional and post-colonial theories were also incorporated to account for intersecting gender, race, and class identities of Filipinas as women of color, Asians, and “Third World women.”  The thesis will show that “Filipinas” and “overseas Filipina workers” are not homogeneous categories and they have various reasons for leaving the Philippines and residing in Hungary, as well as various ways of responding to challenges posed by transnational labor migration. The women OFWs contend with restrictive state power in the form of regulated entry, residence, and exit, along with the discourse of the Philippine government that constructs them as objects that are naturally meant to be marketed as overseas labor. Filipinas in Hungary deal with gendered and racialized notions of who they are as women, workers, and partners. They also encounter racism and issues with migration and employment. However, In the milieu of neoliberal globalization where state and transnational business interests prevail, the women have had to rely on themselves and their informal networks for survival and development given the lack of support or services offered by the Philippine and Hungarian governments.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The crisis had resulted in the intensification of the migration discourse that was never seen before in the country. A part of this intensification was a strong state campaign that has been built on the crisis: a nationalist and hegemonic rhetoric which was rejective and hostile towards migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. This propaganda spoke about migratory processes in the framework of securitization where the process was understood and mobilized as a threat to the European-Christian culture. This narrative was not only rhetorically but visually outstanding. State financed posters and advertisements represented “the migrant” as a voiceless, faceless, male, violent, dark-skinned person who is not even an individual but exists in a horde-like group of people. Besides of this xenophobic and hostile context, counter-hegemonic narratives emerged not just in the form of social movements but, as I argue, in the artistic-visual field too. In my thesis, I focus on this contemporary counter-discourse of the Hungarian cinema through the lenses of three movies which have a privileged position in the “migration movie” corpus in Hungary, not only because all of them was funded by the state but because they earned nationwide recognition. These movies are The Citizen (2016), Jupiter’s Moon (2017) and Easy Lessons (2018). The first part of my research would like to contextualize these movies with special regard to their socio-political and cultural context. For this, I carry out discourse analysis on the already existing literature. After, I make the analysis of the movies themselves to explore the place of them in the discourse on visual representation and migration after 2015. The main questions of the analysis are how these movies are the part of the counter-discourse, what are those circumstances by the dominant state discourse that could challenge free artistic expression, and in which ways aesthetic and political elements are intertwined in the visual language of these movies. The research would like to answer these questions through the politics of (in)visibility and those artistic instruments that aim to transform the unseen “Other” into visible. Therefore the thesis displays two competing visual attitudes towards the representation of migration: one by the neo-authoritarian state propaganda and another by the contemporary Hungarian cinema.",Degree: MA,PDF file (430k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

This research reveals how their culinary projects are coming to terms with a new reality, an expression of their hybrid identity, and at the same time, celebrating the connection with their homelands.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

India has adopted a foreign policy that differs from the general expectations of orthodox International Relations (IR) theories- those focusing on power transitions and international institutions- that assume India eventually would pursue the modification of the current global order- a revisionist behavior- or perhaps would slightly adjust the institutional order, maintaining the status quo. The three-level analysis of India’s foreign policy from 2001 to 2018, shows that India is taking different pathways depending on the level and realm of geopolitical scope. I argue that India is a polyvalent rising power, demonstrating that India pursued a reactive behavior at the local (South Asia) level, at the regional (Indian Ocean Region) level it was characterized by its engagement, while at the global level its role was active.

I adopt a novel approach to tap into the multi-dimensional examination of authoritarianism, concentrating on three dimensions (authoritarian submission, conventionalism, authoritarian aggression) separately. I argue that authoritarian submission, as a psychological construct that stands for obedient relation to political authority and upbringing patterns, has a potential to explain domination of Democratic Party of Socialists – DPS. I test my assumptions using survey research. More precisely, I use two surveys – Montenegrin National Elections Study (2016) – MNES, and a self-designed student survey (2018). Notwithstanding the Montenegrin/Serb ethnic cleavage that remains significant, findings from both analyses confirm that submissive tendencies are relevant for voting this party, thus emphasizing the relevance of psychological factors for the democratic potential of post-communist countries.",,PDF file (1630k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

In 2018, the City of Cape Town – following its worst drought in a century – nearly became the first city of its size to run out of water. At the same time, Israel – a country with a climate similar to that of Cape Town – was also experiencing severe drought. In contrast, Israel showed the exact opposite trend, achieving water security despite these adverse conditions. This paper therefore aims to understand why the water security outcomes for these two regions were so different, given the similar circumstances. The method used for conducting the research is a comparative analysis, examining the threats to water security that both regions face, and how water security is approached. Findings showed that there are several reasons for the differing outcomes. Cape Town faced several challenges that Israel did not, such as the Apartheid and severe poverty; however, it seems that the challenges Israel did face -- such as large immigration waves and settling the desert made Israel’s water sector more resilient overall. This was thanks to the development of management practices such as supply augmentation via large-scale seawater desalination, utilizing treated wastewater, developing efficient agriculture technologies. Cape Town’s water management practices are far less comprehensive and developed. Additional findings show that Israel has prepared for climate change better than CoCT, a practice that may have influenced preparedness for surviving the drought.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (3733k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

In order for the protection orders effectively to fulfil their mission, states, officials of law enforcement authorities and even ordinary citizens must realize the deep-rooted nature of violence against women.

In my thesis, I argue that, in principle, statistical evidence can be a basis for knowledge and conviction, and there is no rationale for discriminating against statistical evidence; the intuitive difference between non-statistical and statistical evidence is merely psychological and can be understood in the light of consideration like the historical development of our intuitions. * * * First, I suggest some scenarios in which the belief is based on statistical evidence yet, according to the criteria from many accounts of knowledge in the market for knowledge. To extend knowledge assignment to even more cases of statistical evidence, I apply a famous distinction from Wilfrid Sellars between ‘manifest image’ and ‘scientific image’ of the world and ourselves to the case of knowledge; I enumerate some of the problems with the intuitive notion of knowledge, discuss some historical considerations to better understand such intuitive reactions and, briefly, explore the possibility of a move towards a more scientific notion of knowledge which not only allows knowledge assignment to many cases with statistical evidence but also can help with addressing some long-lasting issues in epistemology.  Then, I turn to a parallel issue with statistical evidence in the context of legal cases. Discussing three proposals to distinguish the non-statistical and statistical evidence, I argue that none of them manages to provide an independent rationale for such discrimination.  Finally, I address some worries about the reliability of the current statistical methods that are used to produce statistical evidence as well as some concerns regarding the applicability of statistical methods to particular cases and propose some criteria that can help to decide whether a piece of statistical evidence is relevant and can be used as a basis for judgment in each scenario.",Degree: MA,PDF file (728k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

In the theoretical framework of the first chapter, I will provide the reader with a genealogy of the category of human by focusing on the canonical patriarchal understanding of the rational man in Western philosophy, while also addressing the category of human species, so as to illustrate how these approaches formulated research in Artificial Intelligence. In the second chapter, I will provide a close reading analysis of Michel Foucault and Brian Massumi’s scholarship that bridges biopower and capitalism to the affect and the body’s materiality. Based on this, I will read the trope of emotionality used in Sophia’s case in relation to the modulation of affect in late capitalism. This way, I intend to illustrate how Sophia is imbedded in a much more nuanced web of relations of power, one that redefines the boundaries between who is included in the category of the human species and who is not. In the third chapter, by employing Michel Foucault’s analysis on biopower while also engaging with Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis I will draw attention to the discursive traces that construct Sophia’s identity in accordance to the biopolitical technologies of race and sexuality. Finally, in last chapter, drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s analysis on the abstract machine of faciality and Judith Butler’s approach on drag I will reflect on the constructiveness of the boundaries between the human and the non-human, to argue that Sophia is not just a product of her time but also a point of disruption that might unravel what Deleuze and Guattari call, the inhuman in the human.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

Such general process, defined by a departure from exclusively institutional religious worldviews towards more diverse ones, is in tune with what occurs at the latin american/regional and local levels; and yet at the same time it’s also far from being homogeneous to all social realities in which it takes place, as the Peruvian case provides also with examples. Given this contrasting relationship between the local and the global, it is worth questioning as to what is the cause (or causes) attributable for these shared differences in form, but not in content. In the present thesis, I will address this question in arguing that religious socialization experiences, in the form of Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs onwards), are one of the main conditioners for shaping contemporary Peruvian religious and secular worldviews. CREDs are related to instances of observable behavior from an individual’s peers that generate an impact on them, based on how they act accordingly to what is stipulated in their respective religious belief systems or expressed religious convictions. In turn and over time, different CREDs will allow for the acquisition, maintenance or relegation of religious belief and their negotiations, which give rise to diversified worldviews.  For this purpose, I have placed as unit of analysis the age group of Peruvian young adults, (18-29 y.o.) all of them being university students located in Lima-Peru, since, as it will be argued, Peruvian youth within this age group experiences religious socialization in differentiated ways to previous generations, namely, in their general socialization experiences; in the accessing of novel media elements; in the engagement of social movements; and, in the adoption of a consumer ethos.  An interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological approach will be the basis for the elaboration of the argument, in which concepts from the fields of Cognitive Science of Religion and Sociology (in the form of theories of religious socialization) will serve as analytical tools; while grounded techniques based on Q-methodology have been used for the data gathering process of 320 surveys, 43 q-sorts, and 43 structured interviews. As a result of this exploration, a preliminary proposal of ideal-type models of religious and secular worldviews will be outlined. With this exercise, my thesis expects to contribute, not only to the study of contemporary religious worldviews but as an effort for interdisciplinary dialogue between disciplines and fields of research.",Degree: MA,PDF file (864k),ETD,Unrestricted,,

These two issues are explored via the discourse analysis of the magazine, and via unstructured interviews with the magazine employees and vendors. By examining the magazineâ€™s writings, this research illuminates their notions of poverty, homelessness, social inclusion, the role of the state and other safety net institutions. It sheds a new light on how the magazine is used as a platform for opening the questions on discrimination, poverty and mental health issues not discussed in the mainstream media. As such, the magazine serves as a tool for subversive social activism. However, this research also shows that despite the often radical rhetoric, the magazine still implies neoliberal work ethic on its vendors. The interviews with the magazine employees uncover troubling situation with the state institutions and the collapse of the safety net, and the attempts that the magazine is doing to offer support to its vendors. Such support often goes beyond a basic selling training, taking the role of the missing state institutions particularly regarding various trainings for job search and mental health support. Finally, the interviews with the vendors question the market model imposed on them, and ideas of sale efficiency as a mean to improve their social condition during the post-socialist transformation. I argue that the magazine LiceUlice is a valuable platform for both, social activism and support of its vendors, but it also reveals the extent of the neoliberal devastation of the state social institutions, overwhelming poverty and social stratification, and insecurity and risk that marginalised groups face daily in Serbia.",Degree: MA,PDF file (545k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The goal of this thesis is to highlight and analyze how the Russian intervention in Syria is being framed through speech acts, UN statements and interviews by Russian leaders such as President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and UN Permanent Representatives Vassily Nebenzia and Vitaly Churkin internationally as well as at home to the Russian public. In this academic work, I claim that Russia uses the pro-sovereignty argument to justify its intervention in Syria. I conclude that President Putin and other Russian spokespersons are using the pro-sovereignty discourse of intervention rather than the ‘Responsibility to Protect’ reasoning for justifying their involvement in Syria. This paper opens up further scope for future research on the significant role that framing can play in analyzing foreign interventions. Finally, this work also emphasizes that the same pro-sovereignty argument has been used by Russia before during other instances of interventions, and thus can be used for suggesting a broader pattern of behavior from the Russian end.",Degree: MA,PDF file (544k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

Thus, by taking the cases of Romani women who are left in extreme poverty in Romania and, therefore, “forced” to migrate as a strategy of survival to provide for them and their families, I will analyze both the intersectional experiences of Roma women and the forms of resistance they have developed as a way in resisting oppression.Hence, this study also aims to challenge the previous research made on Roma migration to Norway and Western countries by tackling the missing female experiences of Romani women in light of their multifaceted forms of discrimination that stem from being women, Roma, poor, migrants, and homeless.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

These events began in reaction to a homonormative and exclusionary permanent gay nightlife scene. I begin by providing background about Madison, its queer subculture, and the racial and class dynamics within the city. In the first chapter, I address the complications of defining queerness and community in both academic and organizing work, engaging in theoretical understandings of both terms, as well as incorporating the definitions and understandings of research participants. I use discourse analysis to parse the descriptions of several queer pop-up events in Madison and the political engagements of both permanent gay bars and Queer Pressure, a significant queer pop-up event series. In the second chapter, I begin with an analysis of the notion of the sacred within th scene, then move to engage with Jack Halberstam’s concepts of queer temporality and spatiality to consider the implications and possibilites of pop-up and queer takeover style events, in part by reflecting on sets, the spaces the parties take place in, and the transient nature of event series and Madison queers. In the third chapter, I take up the question of queer politics and intersectionality by reading Micheal Warner’s definition of queer politics alongside Lisa Duggan’s conception of the homonormative, and reflect on the resonances of intersectionality and crip theory within these frameworks. I then discuss the homonormative politics of the Madison LGBTQ+ community, and contrast them with an analysis of Queer Pressure’s political commitments. The final section of this chapter is a case study of the No Cops at Pride movement, reactions to and consequences of its engagement with radical queer politics, and a brief analysis of the resonance of this movement in 2018 with the racial justice mass movement of 2020. Ultimately, I do not strive to make any overarching conclusions with this thesis, but rather to take seriously and consider deeply a particular moment in time in the place that I consider home, and to gesture towards a more complex engagement with the queer spaces that exists in between the rural and the urban in the United States.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

However, such assessments are confounded by biases in both the non-random siting of PAs within landscapes as well as differential pressure upon their resources. These biases can be overcome by the use of quasi-experimental counterfactual study designs, that evaluate the impact of PAs against control areas of ‘similar’ biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. To contribute towards this knowledge domain this study presents an assessment of PA effectiveness for the Southeast Asian nation Cambodia, which, in light of its history of natural resource management, represents a pertinent case study. PA effectiveness was analysed using propensity score matching for three different outcome periods between 2010-2018 with the results finding significant positive treatment effects in each, with forested land in PAs being as much as 8% less likely to be deforested than similar unprotected forest. In addition to this a significant positive spillover effect of PAs was observed in 5km buffers zones adjacent to their boundaries, resulting in a maximum of 4% reduction in probability of deforestation.

This act eliminated discrimination against certain ethnic groups that had persisted since the Immigration Act of 1924 which established the National Origins Formula. Under the National Origins Formula, immigration quotas were put into place in order to limit the number of immigrants from regions of the world that would negatively alter the ethnic distribution of the United States. The era within which the Hart-Celler Act was passed was one of a great change in the psyche of the U.S. demos towards a more liberal, global way of thinking by removing these quotas and creating a better system through which residency could be acquired. The changing of times and inability to address it since, however, has led to immigration becoming a forefront of political debate in the United States today. This has culminated in the presidential campaign and subsequent election of Donald J. Trump, whose primary campaign issue revolved around racially charged sentiments and the problems of immigration. My aim here is to assess, from relevant data and evidence, the impact of the Hart-Celler Act by examining a) how it improved or faulted as legislation upon its predecessor – via reallocation of immigration slots from Northern Europe to 3rd world inhabitants or the creation of chain migration – and b) the economic and social consequences that have occurred in the fifty years following. I shall follow this up by developing a normative scale upon which to judge the competing immigration theories, which is succeeded by taking a look at philosophical literature in search of providing a clearer picture regarding the moral debate surrounding immigration today. I conclude a) that Congress passed a law improving on many of the shortcomings of its predecessor, though it has not been spared criticism on pragmatic grounds; and b) that the legislative changes cultivated fairly positive economic consequences. Additionally, I assert that sole adherence to either theory of immigration is too narrow in approaching the problem of reform and that collaborative measures that are understanding of both sides’ interpretations of justice is the most suitable path forward.",,PDF file (924k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

This paper suggests that Dugin’s theory constitutes a genuine and unique example of Right-Heideggerianism and expands on the ideas of conservative revolutionaries through incorporating the major theoretical developments of the 20th century. It is demonstrated that identifying the key premise of Dugin’s approach to political philosophy as the insistence on the ontological primacy of community in relation to the construction of the human self, envisioned in Heideggerian terms, allows for Dugin’s political application of Heidegger’s fundamental ontology to be both sufficiently distinct from present currents in political thought, and flexible to be appropriated as a new conceptual foundation by a wide array of radical conservative and right-wing movements.",,PDF file (884k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

Latour’s actor-network theory increases the range of entities and objects that participate in networks and gives these actors greater agency. The concept of the Anthropocene means that relations between the human and the more-than-human have become central forces, and provides historical, political and economic background to the current ecological crisis. Acceptance of the Anthropocene and Gaia means that we exist in a limited critical zone. Latour and Haraway argue against universalizing ethical systems.

Today, nearly 2 billion people are active users of online markets. E-commerce, in its unique way, is the only borderless market and this feature makes its regulation highly complicated as of today, states are not able to agree on uniform set of rules that will govern the immense online market. The international nature of E-commerce constantly raises legal questions as the law struggles to catch up to a changing world. The non-geographical nature of E-commerce makes the traditional application of choice of law and jurisdiction rules difficult to apply, as these were designed for a pre internet age, based on connection factors, the strongest being geographical in nature. In E-commerce, it is highly complicated for the parties to identify the real location of the other as the transaction is based on informal declarations that are not all the time accurate, and even these geographical indicators can fail while talking about the contracts performed online. In order to ensure predictability and certainty in E-commerce transaction instead of using connecting geographical indicators it would be more useful to identify proper law and jurisdiction based on party autonomy. However even in this hypothesis it is highly probable that improper law and jurisdiction will be applicable. Such risk emerges because of unequal bargain power of the parties, E-businesses are usually assisted by professional lawyers that are able to design the terms of an E-contract in the favor of their clients. At the same time consumers are less likely to be aware about the meaning and consequences of such clauses as choice of law and choice of jurisdiction, furthermore they are not even able to negotiate the terms before agreeing to them. Hence validity and enforceability of these clauses are of a primary importance, especially because of the fast growing online market.

Based on the analysis, I formulate my main hypothesis that the anti-immigrant discourse is the expression of certain form of Pan-European nationalism. In the first chapter of the thesis I will set up the theoretical background and explain the methodology that I will be using, while the second chapter will start with a historical overview of how Europe was conceptualized in the civilizational terms based on its unique culture and tradition. In the second part of this chapter I will make my remarks on different conceptions of European identity from the contemporary perspective. The third chapter consists of brief introduction to transnational populism and civilizationism as the main elements of the anti immigrant mobilization. The main analysis is conducted in chapter four, were I will deconstruct two different types of arguments for anti-immigrant mobilization. The first one that I refer to as the Christian argument is found in the discourse of Viktor Orban who opposes Islam based on its supposed incompatibility with traditional Christian values. On the other hand, secular argument that Wilders uses is based on the commitment to secular ideas and perception that Islam is incompatible with Western liberal values. In conclusion, I will try to answer the more ambitious question: how the anti-immigrant mobilization affects European solidarity and identification with Europe as the common culture? The aim to show that advocates of civilizationist arguments are interpreting those threats as the potential danger primarily to European collective identity, which is contained within their separate national identities. Even when populist anti-immigrant parties ii  claim that they are protecting their own national identities, they are putting it in the context of broader civilizational discourse in which the Muslim Other is a threat to Europe as a whole.",Degree: MA,PDF file (769k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The response to the call for the demonstration was overwhelming and launched an 18-day sit-in within Tahrir Square in Cairo, as well as other sit-ins and demonstrations throughout Egypt and solidarity demonstrations in front of Egyptian embassies abroad, ultimately leading to deposing the former president Muhammad Husni Mubarak in February 2011. Between February 2011 and August 2013, a lifetime’s worth of violent and polarizing clashes and confrontations took place. The end result of these clashes and confrontations is the reinstatement of a military-led authoritarian regime that is cracking down on individual and collective liberties, enforcing harsh austerity measures under the guise of neo-liberal reform, and an increased sense of embitterment concerning living in Egypt. Within the experience of the Revolution, I investigate ‘revolutionary purity’ as a simultaneously powerful and ambiguous force, born out of an Arabic tradition of linking ‘Revolution’ and ‘Purity’ that influenced the trajectory of the Revolution in Egypt. By bringing together the life stories of active participants in the Revolution and my autoethnography as a witness of the Revolution from a distance, I argue that revolutionary purity came into being between the personal and the political; the revolutionaries’ personal aspirations and frustrations, and their unfolding modes of politicization throughout the lifetime of the Revolution. I also claim that revolutionary purity didn’t exist solely within the realm of the Revolution and its time. Its inception can be traced back to the everyday lives of people before the Revolution, as well as today through the experiences of revolutionaries living through the despair of the defeat of the Revolution.",Degree: MA,PDF file (484k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

Out of several branches of law affected by this concept, the research will focus primarily on structuring, i.e. on the choices of corporate vehicles for business operations and legal consequences that such choices brings with them. In addition, special attention will be paid to tax considerations of such options as they by default heavily affect both the choice of business vehicles and operations of private equity industry in general. The primary reason for making such analysis lies in the fact that up to date scholarly works on legal aspects of private equity in Serbia are essentially descriptive. They do not give the answer as to why private equity industry in the country has not made a substantial progress for more than a decade after its regulation. Nor do they establish a comparative model upon which the industry can look upon. In this research, it is suggested that the US system may serve as such model. For these purposes, it explores the characteristics of the US system and the options it offers. The thesis will conclude that having a choice between several business vehicles and tax treatments is beneficial for the development of private equity industry in a country. Notably, the system needs to provide the possibility for private equity funds and firms to operate as flexible entities that are also fiscally transparent. This conclusion outlines the need for the developing countries to constantly reexamine their approach when it comes to the legal treatment of private equity. Overall, the research shows that civil law systems have many lessons to adopt from the American experience with the regulation of private equity industry. Out of it also comes the recommendation for future scholarly works on alternative models for the development of the industry in Serbia.",Degree: MA,PDF file (785k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

Based on 14 first-hand interviews with astronauts, this study utilizes interpretive phenomenological analysis to qualitatively demonstrate that the Overview Effect has a distinct ecological significance that results in positive changes to astronauts’ environmental attitudes and behaviours. Besides this change, the results qualitatively map the breadth and depth of astronauts’ present environmental attitudes and behaviours, which has also not been done prior to this study. The outer space perspective of Earth, which includes negative perceptual views of anthropogenic ecological destruction on the surface of the planet, is shown to add a new and additional element to environmentalism, and as such discourse analysis is used to demonstrate how the ecological impulse concept is useful for advancing theoretical formulations of how spaceflight affects environmental attitudes.

Data collected from interviews and focus group discussion in Dharnai was analyzed using Painuly’s (2001) framework. The findings suggested that significant drivers are unmet demands of consumers, policy ambitions, consumer’s capacity and willingness to pay, benefits of solar perceived by consumers, an indicator of development, and uncertainty about the grid connection. Furthermore, significant barriers to the growth of solar off-grid systems are policy loopholes, unmet demands of consumers, consumer’s affordability, and lack of financing options.

Time as a resource, reflecting the power relations, is distributed unequally within the groups of people, with some spending most of the time working to ensure survival, while others are enjoying vast amounts of discretionary time. In contemporary society, the lack of time is especially acute in the lives of working mothers. The persistent essentialist understanding of motherhood still requires women to devote most of their time beyond paid employment to caregiving, and the standard working hours not taking the time needed for care responsibilities into account. This thesis explores the time poverty experienced by working mothers in Georgia who, due to unregulated working hours and the demands of motherhood, enjoy little to no temporal autonomy. The aim of the research is to analyze the perceptions of time for them and study the ways in which they distribute their time between paid labor, unpaid labor, and leisure and the reasoning behind this arrangement. I argue that the perception of time for working mothers in Georgia, shaped by the essentialist understanding of motherhood, is malleable and adaptable to immediate circumstances, different from the rigidity of capitalist temporality. The data collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews suggest that women perceive time poverty as their individual problem instead of questioning structural inequality leading to this condition; respondents assume that they have more control over their time than they actually do. Over the years, they have adopted different time management and time-saving strategies in order to utilize their time beyond paid employment and meet the contradictory standards of a good employee and a good mother. For this, they often have to juggle several tasks at a time, seek paid or unpaid help from other females, sacrifice their professional growth and leisure time, and put extensive effort into scheduling every minute of their days.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The response and claims being made by these parties will be historically, institutionally, and politically contextualized. In order to do so I will utilize the discourse historical approach of critical discourse analysis and process tracing. In light of this analysis, I argue that the Hungarian Fidesz party, with Orbán at its helm, has engaged in the social creativity strategy of identity management and created a new claim on Christian Democracy. This claim combines nationalism, populism, and civilizationism, wherein the “Christian” component of Christian Democracy is central. The German Christian Democratic Union, headed by Angela Merkel has made no such grand ideological claims but rather has been characterized by caution, pragmatism and centrism. Even while refusing to backdown rhetorically from a defense of the rights of asylum seekers and the responsibility of Germany, and the EU more broadly, to help, their policy making reflected collaboration, cooperation, and concession on these principles. The Austrian People’s Party engages in both approaches, fluctuating between the two without overindulging in either. The approach this paper takes, and the examples put forth by these parties can be utilized to investigate trends in other Christian Democratic parties, or even other party families, in the wake of major events.

While current labor studies focus mostly on the impact of neoliberalization on labor, this thesis demonstrates that experiences of workers, engaged in cultural production in authoritarian states, are conditioned by the state’s endeavor at reproduction of symbolic order and marginalization of those in conflict with the hegemonic state project as well. For this reason, labor of journalists under authoritarian neoliberal regime is characterized as “politically” and “economically” precarious, and these two dimensions of precarity are closely intertwined. Journalists simultaneously face lack of stable contracts, employment insecurity, menace of media outlets being shut-down and even life threat. This research discusses how independent journalists in Russia experience and articulate these insecurities, related to specific economic and political contexts in which their labor is placed. The thesis demonstrates that political dimension of precarity, engendered by the authoritarian regime, is treated by journalists as the most problematic, whereas economic insecurities, albeit solidly present, tend to be ignored. Among the reasons for non- acknowledgement of the economic dimension of precarity are specific understanding of labor journalists share, their liberal ideologies, strong affective bindings to a job, widespread among cultural workers, and privileged class positions.

Towards the stated purpose, I argue for the inclusion of Friedrich Schleiermacher in this modern debate and subsequently construct an argument meant to drive a wedge between incommensurability and untranslatability. I do so in the following way: (1) I argue for the translatability of incommensurable languages and (2) I argue that translatability does not entail commensurability. Finally, I argue that Schleiermacher is ultimately inconsistent but that the argument I have constructed based on his account of translation does not fall along with him.",Degree: MA,PDF file (839k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

By utilizing theories of nationalism, gender, and the state, this thesis seeks to examine the complexities of the postwar reality for survivors of wartime sexual violence in Kosovo and the impacts of gendered nationalism on state-level policy and recognition for survivors. Two dominant narratives have been established: that of the European aspirational ideal and of the Albanian ethno-national invocation of masculine war heroes and freedom fighters. Sexual violence – and victimhood in general – did not fit into these state narratives, further impacting policy priorities. In parallel with dominant state narratives, the taken for granted androcentrism of the state apparatus continues to impact recognition of survivors of wartime sexual violence. I analyze the 2014 Amendment to the Law on Civilian Victims of War in light of the current application process for state-level benefits for survivors, and argue that the Amendment does well to support some survivors, while still maintaining state narratives of singular, ethnic priorities. Thus, since my research is situated in a particular time when survivors are finally able to access state recognition and benefits, the further implications of masculinized state priorities for women are yet to be determined, but a gender-sensitive lens towards state-level support is imperative for survivors.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The thesis works with Cultural Attraction Theory as its main framework and utilizes a case study methodology with discourse analysis. The particular disinformation that it focused on was a 19th century “blood libel”-case concerning immigrant populations and compared it to post-2015 disinforming narratives about refugee-seekers.

Despite the recent legislative developments, the regulation of franchise in Ethiopia is far from being adequate, in particular, it fails to provide a clear regulatory framework and is unable to respond to the existing franchise abuses in Ethiopia. These defects result in lots of uncertainties that will inevitably negatively affect entrepreneurship and the emergence of a viable strong local franchise industry as well as be an obstacle in attracting foreign franchisors which could contribute to the country’s economy. The aim of this thesis is to critically assess the protection of franchisees in Ethiopia as one of the cornerstones of modern business format franchise by analyzing the recent Ethiopian legislative developments aimed at promoting the business model in light of global and local trends as well as the experiences of selected jurisdictions. The comparison will extend to three countries’ laws and experiences. The United States is chosen because of its rich experience in franchise regulation as it is the origin of the business model itself. Hungary was chosen because it represents the other spectrum of the regulation with more historical similarity with Ethiopia and economic proximity in comparison with other European countries and additionally because of similarity in the regulation and protection of franchisees. South Africa has been selected to see the regulation and protection of franchisees because it represents a unique approach to franchise regulation and to see the regulation of franchise from an African perspective.",Degree: MA,PDF file (471k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

I depart from a Gramscian analysis of sectarianism as a historically and politically situated power-sharing mechanism wielded by Lebanese political elites to determine and perpetuate the economic, social, and ideological positions of their members. Within a dialectical framework of resisting sectarianism through political participation, I investigate the possibilities of emergence and conditions of resistance for counter-hegemonic movements in Lebanon. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Beirut, I mobilize the case study of the self-proclaimed counter-sectarian civil society movement “Beirut Madinati.” In particular, by interrogating the inner-workings of “Beirut Madinati,” I argue that this oppositional movement’s ability to resist is hinged on its access to and consumption of a neoliberal sectarian space, economy, and formal discourse, which led to its counter-hegemonic paralysis. Vis-à-vis the case of counter-sectarianism in Beirut, I conclude by emphasizing that instead of focusing solely on the conceptual ideological terrain of resistance, it is imperative to re-imagine scholarly and activism connotations of resistance to include its pragmatic materialization in its situated spatial context.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1334k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The education gap is discussed as a persistent infringement on the right to education and draws on regional and international human rights instruments to discuss the scope of the right to education. The current status quo of the structured systems of France and Germany are conducive to the experienced indirect and direct institutionalized discrimination faced by students with a migrant background. An adaptable, inclusive, and integrative perspective is offered as an alternative to the deficit-oriented approach which emphasizes the cultural and social deficits of migrant communities in France and Germany as the root problem of the education gap.",Degree: MA,PDF file (807k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

Among its tools to reestablish its hegemony, particularly on the young generations of men who witnessed or participated in these political events, the military expanded the reach of conscription even beyond its standard qualifications. It aims to admit as many young men as possible in the mandatory military service to reconstruct them according to its image of militarized masculine citizenship. However, after conducting a series of qualitative interviews with former conscripts, I argue that contradictory experiences of the conscripts during their service render complex this vision of the military. These experiences were marked by the interviewees’ subjective daily negotiations with the difficulties of military life and the institution’s discourse, resulting in different feelings of apathy, depression, and uselessness for many soldiers. The experiences are also complicated by various embodiments the military’s masculine identities, as well as the military’s institutional inconsistencies and bureaucratic ills.",Degree: MA,PDF file (441k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

The tariffs are added in the model to assess the e ects of tariff shocks in the economy. The model closely follows the methodology used in Linde and Pescatori (2017) and Erceg et al.

For the analysis, I use cross-country data on GDP, terms of trade, and tari s available at the World Trade Organization andWorld Bank. As a result, the unilateral increase in tariff rate on the sector of A&S decreases the US GDP, labor and nominal wages. China's retaliation worsens the effects on terms of trade and GDP.

The selection of jurisdictions is made with respect to the rich experience on franchise that comes from United States, the birthplace of business format franchise, that had been followed by Europe. Notably, business format franchise is treated differently in these two continents and that is why an analytical comparison sheds the light over the reasons for regulating, as well positive and negative features of various regulatory regimes. Serbia, on the other hand, is the central subject of this thesis. Franchise in Serbia is treated as an innominate contract, with no particular regulation and developed practice. However, the novelty in Serbia is the Draft of Civil Code that is not yet enacted, but regulates franchise for the first time. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to analyze the Draft and evaluate it by comparison with other regulatory systems.",Degree: MA,PDF file (755k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,
