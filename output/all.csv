The full-fledged model corroborates the developmentalists’ claim regarding the inferential support for imitative learning. It strengthens the argument that infants’ learning of practical skills and artifact functions from observation of adult human agents is an instance of teleological instrumental rationality. However the roles of perceptual, motor, or memory capacities of the human mind are also considered.

The essence of retooling the regime is to better help facilitate the restructuring of such businesses, putting them in a position to return to profitability in such a way that best balances the rights and claims of its stakeholders. Critical to this process is the availability of new financing, first in the interim to keep the business going and then also to help it implement a workable restructuring plan. It cannot be gainsaid that the availability of new financing may determine the success or otherwise of the restructuring efforts. Lending by itself presupposes some risks. This riskiness is further exacerbated by the fact of financial distress. Intuitively, lending to distressed businesses will not be ordinarily typical for providers of financing. This has spurred the growing need to incentivize providers of financing to distressed businesses. On the flipside, it has also informed the need to check possible overreaching, occasioned by new financing whether by pre-distress lenders or by new lenders who for various reasons are now becoming the face of distress lending.  These issues are addressed in this dissertation on a comparative basis, analyzing the approaches in the US, UK and Germany and drawing lessons for frontier markets like Nigeria which is at the threshold of reworking its bankruptcy regime in the light of the growing acceptance of restructuring as an important part of the that regime. The Nigerian analysis is of relevance to similarly placed frontier markets.  The dissertation investigates and shows that jurisdictional approaches to statutory incentivizing of new financing differ along the lines of two articulated approaches: a prescriptive approach on the one hand, and a market-based approach on the other. Thus, while on the one hand, there is a prescriptive approach, which spells out defined explicit rules for providing new financing, protection for prior lenders, on the other hand, there is a market-based approach, which emphasizes the role of the market as the better judge of when a distressed lender may be incentivized, how the incentives may be designed, and what concession prior lenders may be willing to make. In the face of these two competing approaches to incentivizing new lending, the dissertation examines the underlying indices that support this divergence in the articulated approaches.  The dissertation further investigates the use of new financing agreements as instruments of lender capture, given their implications for other stakeholders of the business. In this regard, the dissertation critically examines the theoretical justifications for the key provisions of such agreements and, on a comparative basis, existing principles that can be used to countermand overreaching provisions of such agreements.  Finally, while pointing out the role of the distressed debt market as a source of distressed financing with growing importance, the dissertation argues that courts can play a key role in balancing the misalignments that can arise from the participation of distressed debt investors as financers in the restructuring process. In a related sense, the dissertation critically examines the manifestation of the distressed debt market in emerging markets like Nigeria and the opportunity presented through non-performing loans, arguing that the regulatory pattern of entry into the market may dis-incentivize distress debt investing in a market that is in dire need of financing.",PDF file (2894k),ETD,,Corporate reorganizations,,PhD

Paradigm changes are implemented in societies first and foremost through a redefinition of indicators. Our current indicator systems do not take into account the complexity of human social, economic and material systems and prioritize “efficiency” and “growth”. The objective of this research was to develop an indicator for one type of anthropogenic complex systems, i.e. cities that took into account the complex nature of the system and provided a quantitative way to prioritize alternative values such as “resilience” and “sustainability”. Scaling has been identified as one measure of complexity in a system, which is relatively easy to compute and comprehend. Here, I have developed a scaling indicator for cities based on fractal dimension. US block wise census data was used to calculate the exponent of the power-law distribution of population density across different census blocks in a city. The power-law, or scaling indicator, herein referred to as the fractal dimension was then compared to parameters such as population, area, population density, gasoline sales, gasoline sales per capita and area, and carbon emissions and carbon emissions per capita. It was noted that the fractal dimension had a power-law correlation with gasoline sales per unit area in the cities. The analysis was then extended a second complex system, i.e. national economies. Fractal dimension or scaling of percentages of incomes across the highest earning to lowest earning twenty percent segments of the population was calculated using World Bank economic data for 2004 (the year for which most extensive dataset was available). The relationship between this scaling indicator and energy usage per capita in countries was again found to be a power-law with an r-square value of more than 0.35 (similar to the correlation between urban fractal dimension and gasoline sales per area in cities). A new planning tool is developed to allow incorporation of consideration of these complexity indicators in development planning for cities and national economies. The planning-plane allows for visualization of the impacts of particular interventions in cities (e.g. housing scheme) and economies (e.g. changes in tax-code) on energy consumption parameters across two independent variables (e.g. population and fractal dimension) instead of the usual practice of using one indicator (e.g. population density). The similar nature of the correlation between scaling indicators and energy consumption indicators in two completely different anthropogenic complex systems hints at some underlying similarity in the mechanism through which these complex systems develop. It is hypothesized here that steeper scaling (e.g. higher income differences in economies) in complex systems makes good system regulation more energy intensive, thereby affecting the energy consumption parameters as observed in this study. Steeper scaling also thus negatively affects the effectiveness of regulation in complex systems and makes the system more prone to internal shocks. Planning system evolution for resilience would thus benefit from consideration of scaling indicators in the planning process.",ETD,Unrestricted,City planning -- Environmental aspects,,PhD

Frankfurt developed his hierarchical theory of desires. This controversial theory led to fruitful debates not only in connection with the problem of free will but in other areas as well including personal and practical identity, rationality in action and the problem of agency in general. Thus, this dissertation is not focused on the problem of free will but on the role of second-order desires in agency. More particularly, it discusses the importance of two features of human agency that Frankfurt emphasized most. First, humans are reflective, that is, they can evaluate their own desires. Second, humans are capable of caring about things, that is, some things are important for them in a special way. Frankfurt understands both of these crucial abilities as based on our ability to have second-order desires. In agreement with Frankfurt, I will argue that both reflectivity and caring are very important and basic abilities, and that they are connected to each other. However, I will disagree about their relation and about the definition of caring as dependent on second-order desires. I will argue that caring in the most basic sense is not a reflective ability but a first-order evaluation which is centrally important to action. I will also try to show that the reason humans have second-order desires is that they care about things. Thus, our second-order desires should be based on our personal values; in other words, what we care about. As a consequence, the most important claim of this dissertation is the following: though humans are reflective creatures, it is not reflectivity that is the most important feature of human life. Rather, caring, as a first-order evaluation is more important and our ability to reflect about our motivation depends on being able to care about things in this sense. At the end of the dissertation I will briefly discuss a serious problem for any caring based theory of action: the problem of self-control and self-management. Since we do not directly control by decisions what we care about, it seems that we cannot have these abilities. However, I will try to sketch a method of self-control and self-management which is consistent with the importance of the redefined concept of caring and which is based on self-trust and openness. This method will add one more argument against the importance of reflectivity: second-order desires do not help us in managing our desires; rather, they can interfere with self-control and become self-defeating strategies.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (694k),ETD,,Free will and determinism,,PhD

Established 20 years ago as a voluntary cooperation initiative on higher education cooperation in Europe, the BP has set important policy objectives for national higher education systems and Europe at large. While government representatives, through the ministerial meetings constantly agree on what they should implement in their national higher education systems, implementation reports show considerable differences between countries and higher education institutions (HEIs) with regard to implementation. Starting with the early stages of the BP scholarly work has demonstrated that there is an increasing interest in studying the different dimensions of BP implementation. A considerable amount of these studies has focused on assessing and explaining the different levels of BP implementation yet there is a gap in addressing the implementation of the BP from an integrated perspective. This dissertation aimed to fill this gap and asked What are the factors explaining the different levels of implementation of higher education policies within the Bologna Process? First of all, this dissertation seeks address the research gap by focusing on specific policy areas within the BP (quality assurance and the social dimension), diverse county contexts and higher education institutions within such contexts (Moldova, Portugal, and Romania). Secondly, it aims to contribute to the broader policy implementation literature by providing a conceptual understanding of policy implementation, by breaking it into adoption, transposition and practical implementation, and by putting forward an integrated set of factors for each of the three implementation stages, and empirically test them through semi-structured interviews. The dissertation hypothesizes three causal mechanisms for each of the implementation levels. Firstly, is hypothesized that adoption is the result of policy fit between commonly agreed policies at the BP level and national preferences and interests, as resulted through national representatives’ participation in BP. The causal model predicts that if BP policies have the support of top domestic actors and structures, this may push the national policies closer to the ones promoted by the BP. As a result, BP structures prefer to collaborate with those domestic actors who are in favor of its policies. Secondly, specific to the transposition stage it can be hypothesized that mutual learning and other socialization processes equip governmental agencies and bodies, societal actors, and the academic community with information about the main developments at the EHEA level and contribute to national level policy-making by feeding back national policy makers, affecting the choice for specific policy instruments and implementation mechanisms. Last but not least, at the HEIs level rectors and top-managers, academic and administrative staff, and students develop institutional plans and policies in line with the national level policies or the BP depending on their participation as stakeholders in the policy-making processes, autonomy and the added value of the policies in question. First of all, this dissertation highlighted the complex relationship between the BP, national, and institutional policy-making and the importance of national and institutional (interest) structures, actors (coalitions) and processes in connecting these levels. While it is assumed that that there is a “filter” when it comes to the implementation the BP commitments, with each level and layer of policy-making preconditioning the following (adopting the necessary legislation, transposition and institutional practices) this dissertation has shown that this is very much dependent on the policy in question. Quality assurance (QA) is a rather structural and technical area, with clear conceptualizations and operationalizations, with structures and bodies at the European, national and institutional level, whereas the social dimension (SD) is underdeveloped in this respect. HEIs implement QA policies because of the competitive environment they have to operate in but also because of the existent monitoring mechanisms (at the institutional, national and BP level). The SD is a rather sensitive area, with most of the universities putting forward their preferred approaches on how to deal with such issues. If in the case of QA in most of the country cases there is a national level agency which pushes for implementation at the HEIs level, in the case of SD the situation is loose.",ETD,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD

Having been a women’s organization in the Ukrainian diaspora and an ethnic organization in American and international women’s movements from its inception, the UNWLA often considered its participation in international women’s forums instrumental in promoting the cause of Ukraine’s sovereignty. Instead of withdrawing from this arena in the early years of Ukraine’s independence, however, the UNWLA started to adopt the women’s rights and equality discourses for generating relations with the state and non-state actors in Ukraine and for conceptualizing a vision for the organization’s future. Drawing on fieldwork findings from the New York City branches of the organization, I argue that the current shift in the UNWLA’s relation to women’s rights movement has been triggered not only by the changes in the political status of their homeland, but also by the generational shift in the UNWLA membership as well as by the growing currency of women’s rights discourses in the international politics.",Degree: PhD,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,PhD

First, we discuss the operator theoretic counterparts of the central ergodic theoretical notions of strong and weak mixing. These concepts correspond to particular types of asymptotic behaviour of operator semigroups in the weak operator topology, called weak and almost weak stability. Using functional analytic tools and methods from ergodic the- ory, we describe various features of (almost) weakly stable semigroups. In particular, we show that (in the Baire category sense) typical elements in certain natural spaces of semi- groups are almost weakly but not weakly stable, thus we carry over classical theorems of Halmos and Rohlin for measure preserving transformations to the Hilbert space operator setting. Further, we illustrate operator semigroup methods and results on a class of telegraph systems with various boundary conditions. We study both linear and nonlinear boundary value problems. The stability of linear telegraph systems is discussed by applying theorems from the previous chapters. For the existence of solutions, we are particularly interested in time-dependent boundary conditions, since this case has little been investigated so far. The operator semigroup techniques applied to the case of Lipschitz continuous non- linearities are combined with estimates from the theory of monotone operators to yield well-posedness and the regularity of the solutions, also in the case of dynamic boundary conditions.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (550k),ETD,Unrestricted,Measure theory,,PhD

It focuses on the d65, which is a critical case for East-West labor transnationalism in view of the importance of cost comparisons among car plants in different countries. The analysis of Polish-German union relations at three car and car component manufacturing companies, Volkswagen’s engine plants, GM and MAN, shows that the German unions sought to establish cooperative links with their Polish counterparts in the areas subject to cross-border comparisons, when no national negotiation channels were available to them and thus the danger of underbidding by the cheaper Polish plants was particularly high. The Poles, in turn, cooperated in exchange for the Germans’ support, only if they expected to benefit more from the Western assistance than from local solutions. Alternatively, they did not hesitate to utilize their comparative advantage of lower wages and inferior working conditions to attract new production. The resulting cooperation was based on reciprocal exchange. The Germans helped the Poles build up their organizations and assisted them during disputes with the local management, whereas the Poles committed themselves not to underbid the Germans during investment distribution rounds. Overall, East-West European labor transnationalism was guided primarily by cost-benefit considerations. The evidence on GM unions’ reactions to the economic crisis of 2008-2009 corroborates this assertion, showing that German employee representatives used enhanced government access to secure the interests of their sites at the cost of other locations, which led to deep divisions in the once unified cross-border GM labor front.  The last chapter tests the above arguments against evidence from the construction sector, in which the inflow of CEE workers to West European labor markets constituted a major source of competitive pressure. It shows that the mechanism governing interactions between Polish and German construction unions resembled the one identified in the car industry. Specifically, the scope of cooperation remained narrower due to the German union’s attachment to national solutions and limited gains derived by the two Polish organizations from participating in migrant workers’ assistance schemes.","CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD

I propose an investigation which unfolds in two parts. In the first part, I examine the relationships that hold between personal autonomy, political authority and rationality, focusing on a reading of these relationships according to which, even though autonomous individuals may not a have reason to comply with the directives of political authority as long as they consider the matter from the standpoint of individual rationality, they may nevertheless have a reason to comply with such directives if they consider the matter from the standpoint of collective rationality. I explore the strengths and limitations of a model that tries to provide the normative foundations of political obligation by employing the principle of collective rationality, and conclude that, while the principle of collective rationality plainly dictates a greater level of compliance with the law than the principle of individual rationality taken in conjunction with an individual’s moral values would dictate, the same considerations which are invoked to establish the need to appeal to a principle that would give one a reason to obey the law over and above what substantive moral principles working within the framework of individual rationality give one reason to do might render implausible any attempt to account for political obligation by reference to such substantive moral principles. To deal with this difficulty, I introduce a particular conventionalist account, hoping to take a step in the direction of rehabilitating the idea that the reasons for obeying the law can be accounted for by appeal to substantive moral considerations.  In the second part, I scrutinize the main arguments used within the conventionalist framework that I focus on in order to back up the claim that political obligation, if it exists, can only be accounted for in terms of interdependent reasons for action. I look at the idea that a promising strategy in dealing with the problem of political obligation is to show that the treatment of ordinary coordination problems can be extended to other game theoretic situations, such as the prisoner’s dilemma. I find that the conventionalist account is able to answer the objection that any conventionalist account of authority and political obligation is misguided because the conventionalist analysis cannot properly be applied to situations of significant conflict of interests. I also argue that, in order to defend the conventionalist view according to which political obligation is to be justified by reference to a pattern of mutual expectations, one should make crucial use of the idea of cooperative dispositions. To this end, I show that conventionalists are right in claiming that assumptions about cooperative dispositions are not ad hoc, and, hence, that conventionalism can make sense of the idea that patterns of mutual expectations are not immune to moral criticism.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (1326k),ETD,Unrestricted,,Political obligation,,PhD

Notwithstanding the persistent interest in the study of state censorship, the aspect that certain levels of coordination have to occur under invariably vague regulations is surprisingly neglected. Yet, given the role played by censorship in sustaining non-democratic regimes, the Soviet-type for instance on which the present analysis is centered, how the system internally managed to deal with uncertainties concerning censorship norms, and how the main actors coped with it, is surely a pertinent question. The research was designed to address both formal and informal aspects of the censorship process. For assessing formal organizational solutions, I use mid-level theories developed in the vein of the structural contingency approach to organizational design, whereas for the study of informal practices, I draw on theoretical insights offered by the comparative political science literature and a conceptual typology of informal practices/institutions that I developed based on three typologies (Nee and Ingram 1998, Lauth 2000, Helmke and Levitsky 2006a). In terms of methods, I combine institutional analysis and historical ethnography, which involves processing data derived from official documents and subjective sources (interviews, memoirs, diaries and contemporary correspondence). The empirical analysis is based on a single case, that is, the Romanian censorship system in the state socialist period (1949–1989). Within the case, the focus on formal mechanisms is narrowed to the extreme end of the pre-publication procedure, the activity of local censors’ offices namely. With regards to informal mechanisms, the analysis is focalized on positive interpersonal relationships between the actors of the censorship system, particularly those nurtured among the controllers and controlled, and the allied informal practices. The intensive analysis of the Romanian case resulted that the effective implementation of the censorship policy was maintained by a complex set of formal organizational coordination and control mechanisms that were appropriately designed to meet critical contingencies (i.e. task uncertainty), as well as by various types of informal practices based on trust-centered interpersonal ties. The types of informal practices that furthered the formal scopes of censorship include the spread and clarification of information regarding censorship norms via peers and censors (complementary informal practices), censors sharing confidential directives (accommodating practices), as well as counseling and ensuring with controllers prior to official checking (substitutive practices). The fourth type comprises interactions that eventually undermined the effectiveness of the censorship policy, practices such as negotiations between the censors and editors-in-chief/authors, intervening through personalized networks on behalf of a publication, or taking a risk by turning a blind eye to problematic issues (competing of practices). These findings complement accounts of the functioning and effectiveness of the Soviet-type censorship system primarily focused on macro institutional and organizational configurations. Furthermore, the results shed light on practices constituting the domain of “self-censorship”, which is also claimed by the literature to represent an important factor contributing to the effectiveness of censorship. Finally, by focusing on positive interpersonal ties and related practices, the findings considerably alter the dominant narrative centered on negative relationships between the controllers and the controlled, yet they also show that many interactions based on positive ties had the same effects as their negative counterparts: raising the performance of the censorship system.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2650k),ETD,Unrestricted,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD

It explores agromanufacturing- from the colonial period to the present-day Kenya to show the evident underlying continuity of colonial structures and contradictions characteristic of different large-scale commercial agriculture as a strategy of national and regional development across the country. By focusing on everyday lives of the plantation labourers in the South Nyanza sugarbelt, the dissertation reveals the nature and dynamic of development generally and the large scale commercial farming economy in particular as unpredictable and chaotic. What is more significant from the findings is the demonstrated acceptance, integration and accommodation of chaos into the constitutive and operational logic of the plantation economy and its development itinerary. Throughout the dissertation, the relations between the agromanufacturing complex as a structure designed for modernization intervention and the invisible everyday lives of those in its orbit are shown to be characterized by unpredictability, contradictions, differentiations, violence, deprivations and exploitative dispossession. Combined, these make lives under such development interventions insecure, disjointed, vulnerable and disorderly. My study contributes to the sociology and social anthropology of development by proposing a fresh look at development interventions as ‘chaotic projects’ which produce disorder rather than smooth solutions to technical disorder. Such a look, building on works of other such as Tania Li and James Ferguson, integrates the ideas of Foucault to show how development has in effect become a series of normalizations where more attention is focused on making things seem normal rather actually transforming them. For instance, the study shows how dispossession of land, labour and employment safeguards are part of repertoire of tactics employed to enhance efficiency and productivity in the factory though they expose the plantation workers and villagers to extreme deprivation and invisibility. Furthermore, the study responds to the significant absence of a disciplinary society approach to development related research in Africa though much of the interventions are implemented as disciplinary projects. By combining Foucault’s conception of power and the concept of chaos in studying agromanufacturing as development in Kenya, the study shows how development is not only chaotic but sustained by chaos: under development, disorder is the order. This is the central argument in the dissertation.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2632k),ETD,Agriculture -- Economic aspects -- Kenya,,PhD

On the other hand, the enhanced self-consciousness or even pride of the Renaissance author compared to that of the earlier medieval one is a long established commonplace; indeed, humanist poets were inclined, in varying degrees, to self-fashioning, self-mythologizing. My interdisciplinary study focuses on the junction of these two basic habits of mind of German humanists around 1500. I reveal solar and astral (mainly astrological) symbolism in Neo-Latin poetical works and visual artworks of this period, and investigate how this cosmic symbolism was used for self-representative purposes. Among the German humanists I focus on Conrad Celtis (1459-1508), the “„arch-humanist” of Germany, the first poet laureate of his nation, the ""bringer of the muses"" to the German land. Celtis's personality, poetic talent, ambition, scientific-philosophical interests, his assumed role − all this resulted in various interesting ways of ""cosmic"" self-representation; I argue that this is a core area of his whole poetical oeuvre. In the investigated period of German humanism (c. 1485-1510), some other poets who were friends of Celtis also employed astronomical, astrological, cosmological imagery in the construction of their (or the group's) humanist identities, in various ways, to various extent: Jakob Locher, Laurentius Corvinus (Rabe), Johannes Tolhopf, Augustinus Moravus; I involve in my research representative works of these authors, too. The first chapter reviews the poetological background of the enhanced vates-ideology of the German humanists: the humanist revaluation of poetry in the Renaissance and the “„defense of poetry” tradition. The second chapter overviews Celtis’s ideas about astronomy-astrology, micro- and macrocosm in general. Chapters 3-6 explore Celtis’s and his firends’ strategies of “„cosmic” self-representation through analyses of specific works. Humanists could support their vates-role by means of their (idealized) birth horoscope or the horoscope of laureation (ch. 3-4); or they could develop a complex Phoebean symbolism based on Phoebus, the solar god who supports the poet in various ways (ch. 5). Humanist group-identity could be strengthened through a Phoebean-Bacchic symbolism and the mythologizing of humanist feasts (ch. 6).",Degree: PhD,PDF file (9848k),ETD,Unrestricted,,,PhD

Based on low wages and low taxes, the country’s political economy mitigates against the emergence of а ‘broad middle’ habitually associated with the developed welfare states of the West. 80% of the working population ekes out less than 500 EUR monthly, making Bulgaria the poorest EU-member state. After three decades of neoliberal reforms, the country’s class structure resembles that of a Third world country: a tiny opulent minority sits atop a vast ocean of poverty. The unpopularity of this mode of economic development prompted the liberal ideologues of the Transition to create a social base for the liberal reforms in the early 2000s, a project that culminated with the 2013 anti-corruption protests. Therefore, I analyze the insurgent “middle class” as a political, rather than economic formation. More specifically, I explore the formation of the Bulgarian middle class from the vantage point of the 2013 summer protests. That year saw feverish protest mobilizations in two phases in winter and summer. Even though these protests occupy determinate temporal frames, their significance reverberates to this day because commentators continue to make sense of current events through the prism of the “long 2013.”  Time and again pundits and participants stated that the summer protests portended the birth of the middle class. I follow these discussions in the public sphere and tease out the vectors of inclusion into the self-identified middle class.  The first part of the thesis focuses on class formation and class consciousness where class is understood in materialist yet non-economistic terms. I offer a way of thinking about the problem of the ‘middle class’ that breaks with the double objectivism of structural and mechanical theories extrapolating its existence from the laws of capital in Orthodox Marxism, on the one hand, and from liberal stratification theories which rely on arbitrary income brackets to discern its existence, on the other. Because of the strong emphasis on class polarization, inherited from the Manifesto, the ‘middle class’ has traditionally posed a challenge Marxists have tended to overcome via a recourse to Weberian ‘prosthetics’.  In contrast, I treat class as a political becoming, every class is always-already a “class against”. Thus, a ‘subjectivist’ approach to social class is well suited to understand this formation. To this end, I fashion a theoretical apparatus out of Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology and the Essex School’s Discourse Theory to account for the discursive and polemical constitution of the middle class of the 2013 summer protests. This theoretical amalgam offers a polemical slant to theorizing class formation, resonating with some early remarks on the political nature of social class by Karl Marx.  I do so against the backdrop of the thorny path of the neoliberal reform in Bulgaria. I argue that the middle class is the crystallization of a long search on part of policy elites, civil society practitioners and democratization experts to find the “social base” for the neoliberal reform, perceived as increasingly beleaguered by populism, left and right.  One such challenge to the reform consensus came in the wake of the winter protest of 2013. It rebelled against austerity, poverty and the political establishment, yet it did so by poaching the liberal semantic field and appropriating the language of “civil society”. The summer protests re-appropriated the appropriation and, in the process, subjectivized itself as “middle class” against the winter protests and the corrupt oligarchic elite.  The second part of the thesis traces the effects the 2013 class imaginaries exert on the formal and universalistic political equality under liberalism. The discourse of “the middle class” organized the protesters’ normative visions about citizenship and national identity along increasingly inegalitarian, demophobic and elitist lines.  This dissertation thus follows an instance of ‘class struggle’ unfolding on the terrains of civil society, citizenship and nationhood. I show how the radicalization of imaginaries about class difference are projected onto the political field resulting in a tendency to question formal equality under liberalism.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (4468k),ETD,Middle class -- Bulgaria,,PhD

In the last four decades many linguist, philosopher and cognitive scientist, working on an account of how we communicate by means of metaphors, started with pointing out what Davidson got wrong or right. His view that metaphor carries no special meaning or content different form the literal meaning of the expressions it is comprised of, that it is simply a tool to draw our attention to similarities, served as the starting point for many to articulate their own theory (cf. Bergmann, 1982; Rorty and Hesse, 1987; Moran, 1989; Hills, 1997; Stern, 2000; Camp, 2003; Guttenplan, 2005; Reimer and Camp, 2006; Camp, 2008; Stern, 2008; Reimer, 2008; Lepore and Stone, 2010). is thesis is no different. I think what Davidson essentially got right is emphasizing the causal effects of metaphors, i.e., that metaphors nudge us into noting similarities, to take on a new perspective on the mentioned things. He also thought—to anticipate, this will be where I disagree—that this is the ulterior aim of metaphor and the metaphorical speaker. Consequently, according to Davidson, there is no special meaning the speaker aims to convey, given that this effect can be achieved by the literal meaning of the uttered sentence, or its comprehension thereof. is is not to deny that the metaphor has a point iv or that it inspires a lot of thoughts. In his Communication and Convention, Davidson (1984, 273) links what he calls ulterior purposes of utterances to John L. Austin’s notion of perlocution (Austin, 1962); acts people perform by uttering sentences. Such an act for instance is, making the audience to undertake certain actions by asking them to do so, or to surprise them by what one is saying. Given this much, Davidson (1978) can be described as developing a perlocutionary theory of metaphor (cf. Lepore and Stone, 2010). My aim is to show that a perlocutionary theory does not have to follow Davidson’s arguments and conclusions, just roughly outlined above. After a careful examiniation of the notion of metaphorical meaning, the perspectival effect of metaphors, and the notion of perlocution and perlocutionary effects, I will argue, first, that metaphors’s effect of making us see something in a new light is indeed a perlocutionary effect. I call this the Perlocution Claim. Second, I will also point out that achieving perlocutionary effects are not necessarily the ulterior purposes of the speakers. In most cases, they are just one among the many intended effects a speaker can have in uttering something. Consequently, Davidson’s claims about the casual effects of metaphors will not support his conclusion that there is no metaphorical meaning beyond the perspectival effect of metaphors, in as much as there are examples where eliciting the metaphorical effect is not the final aim of the speaker. Examples are not hard to find, and they support the existence of metaphorical meaning contrary to Davidson. Nevertheless, recent theories of metaphorical meaning do not fit well with the Perlocution Claim. Partly, because they reject the claim as belonging to Davidsonian non-cognitivsm (cf. Stern, 2000), a label introduced to designate theories denying the existence of metaphorical meaning. Additionally, because they also consider perlocutionary effects to be final, non-linguistic, aims of utterances. e proposed theory of metaphor endorsing the Perlocution Claim relies on the v distinction between different possible realizations of perlocutionary effects. It incorporates a non-cognitivist theory for some examples of metaphors while at the same time, using the same theoretical framework, it provides an account of how metaphorical utterances have a special meaning on certain occasions. As a theory of metaphorical meaning, it is close to that developed by Elisabeth Camp (2003; 2008; 2014) on which if there is a metaphorical meaning, it is an inexplicit meaning which the hearer has to recover by way of cultivating the perspective offered in the metaphor.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (641k),ETD,,Language and languages -- Philosophy,,PhD

Previous comparative research emphasized the role of institutions in conditioning individuals’ behavior and attitudes. I argue that not only the institutional design, but also the quality of the political institutions in the country constrains citizens’ political attitudes, preferences, and decisions. I do this by examining how living in countries with different quality of governance affects people’s institutional trust,perceptions of representation and accountability, attitudes towards the welfare state, voting behavior, and election results both in an absolute sense and relative to the design of the political institutions. Doing so this dissertation builds on and contributes to the literature of comparative political behavior, contextual effects, and political institutions, and has substantive and normative implications for the study of electoral democracy. All of the empirical analyses are cross-national and employ multilevel analyses of data from Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the World Value Survey, and different indicators of the quality of governance and political institutions.  After a brief introduction, I examine the implications of various aspects of good governance on individuals’ confidence in different public and political institutions. I find that some aspects of good governance have a stronger impact on institutional trust than others, but how the institutions provide judicial and bureaucratic efficiency and control of corruption clearly makes them look more or less trustworthy. I then look at the role of the quality of governance in shaping individual preferences toward income redistribution and social welfare policies, and find that bad governance leads to a remarkable inconsistency in individuals’ preferences, preferring more extensive social benefits simultaneously with less income redistribution. I investigate further whether people feel less represented and politicians’ less accountable under bad governance in chapter four. I find that institutional design matters more for a sense of procedural representation, while good governance is more important for substantive representation. Chapter five focuses on the link between the impact of ideology, economic evaluations and partisanship on the vote on the one hand, and corruption on the other, and the implications of cultural norms for these relationships. I find that as corruption rises, ideological considerations and sympathies towards the chief executive party weigh less in voters’ decision; and while living in a country with a strong culture of corruption does not make people adopt different voting behavior, it instills a higher likelihood of voting against the incumbent. Before concluding, I test the electoral implications of good governance for incumbent’s survival in chapter six, and find that the quality of governance is as important as the economy.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2002k),ETD,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD

The creation of the anthology was personally initiated by emperor Alexios Komnenos (1081-1118) and was related with the religious politics of the Byzantine Empire. In the history of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, this anthology remained as an important contribution in the systematization of the legacy of the Church Fathers and the cannon of texts which were used in the theological debates. The text gained considerable popularity with more than Greek 150 manuscripts and translations into Old Slavonic and Latin. The Panoplia consists of 28 chapters. Each of the initial seven chapters is dedicated to an important orthodox belief, while each of the following chapters refutes a major heresy in the history of the Church from the early Christian times until the twelfth century. The text is well known to the scholars dealing with Byzantium but has remained largely unexplored because of its length and monumental tradition. This thesis represents two episodes (loosely connected) in the transmission history of the anthology. The first section situates the Panoplia in the context of early modern Europe with the publication history of the first printed edition in Greek which happened in Wallachia in 1710. The dissertation proves that this edition was initiated by the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem in relation to the proselytizing activities of the Catholics and the Protestants. The inner conflicts among the Orthodox Christians necessitated the edition and the publication was connected with the coeval Eucharistic debates, which had their origins in Western Europe but were interiorized on Orthodox soil. The second part treats one single manuscript – MS Iviron grec 281 -- which shows significant differences from the Wallachia edition and the other Panoplia manuscripts which I was able to consult. Compared to the edition, the Iviron MS omits many of the Patristic texts, but adds scholia to the fragments of Pseudo-Dionysios the Areopagite and the orations of Gregory the Theologian (Orationes 28, 29, 30, 31, 38). The present study gives a sample of these scholia: it treats the fragments of Gregory of Nazianzos’ De Theologia, Oratio 30 and In Theophania, Oratio 38 as well as the five short scholia to the Pseudo-Dionysian fragments. The sources on the scholia to the text of the Areopagite lead to Ambigua ad Thomam of Maximus the Confessor. For the rest of the scholia, I was able to identify most of them as fragments authored by Nicetas Heracleensis and Elias Cretensis, two among the most prominent commentators of the Theologian.

The research reconstructs debates and dialogues between progressive clergy and radical religious intelligentsia following the massacre of Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905. The dissertation interprets the visions that emerged in the network of the Orthodox left in the framework of ‘political theologies’. It focuses on three programs and their theo-political language: the Brotherhood of Zealots for Church Renovation; the Christian Brotherhood of Struggle; and the Union of Christian Politics. Members argued that the mutually dependent relationship between the tsar and the people, which served as a political bedrock for the Empire for centuries, was now beyond repair. The bloodshed was perceived as a fundamental break in Russian Orthodox political theory, and the horrible events inspired religious intelligentsia and progressive clergy to theorise about politics and social justice as Orthodox believers. The dissertation identifies the concept of Christian obshchestvennost’ (sociality) as the focal point of all programs that emerged among advocates of the Orthodox left in the period. The concept had palingenetic power, it was meant to reinvigorate the Church and to re-Christianise the whole of fin de siècle Russian society. My research argues that the theo-political imagination and language of the Orthodox left was inspired both by Russian Orthodox tradition, in particular by Modern Russian Theology; and by non-Orthodox traditions of social Christianity, but it developed in opposition to the Marxist left.

This inquiry involves an interdisciplinary approach, combining history, theology, philosophy, and philology. At the beginning of the fourth century, after Christianity changed its status from persecuted to official recognition in the Roman Empire, an “ascetic revolution” spread especially among the members of the high aristocracy and of the middle-class. Sometimes several members of the same family, men and women, embraced the ascetic enthusiasm, experimenting with different ascetic modi vivendi in proximity to each other or in cohabitation. While authoritative Church Fathers legitimized some of the newly emerging communities, at the same time, they rejected other forms of double-gender asceticism, which they labelled as chaotic and “unruly.” Family double monasteries are rooted in the pious Late Antique households, generally belonging to the high aristocracy, with one notable exception – precisely the very one that had set the tone for this practice. Relatives, men and women, shared their inclination towards asceticism in proximity to each other either on their own family estates, or in new places. They formed quarters of monks and nuns who belonged to the same monastic unit, sometimes having a unique guidance (often a woman), they were economically and liturgically interdependent, but they lived separately and their encounters were thoroughly regulated. Thus, the flourishing communities which sprang from a family milieu and received the recognition of the Church Fathers are, in chronological order, the monastery of Tabennesi (Upper Egypt), founded by Pachomius and his sister, Mary (ca. 333-336); the monastery in Annisa (Cappadocia), which developed on the family estate of Macrina the Younger, her mother, and her brothers (ca. 345-356); the community founded in Bethlehem by Jerome, his brother, Paulinianus, and his spiritual daughter, Paula, together with the latter’s daughter, Eustochium (386); the monastery of Nola, founded by Paulinus and his wife, Therasia (395-396), which became a magnet for other ‘monastic spouses’ and formed a monastic network; the monastery which emerged at Primuliacum due to Sulpicius Severus, his wife, and his mother-in-law, Bassula (396-403); and the monastery founded on the Mount of Olives by Melania the Younger, her husband, Pinianus, and her mother, Albina (431-436). At the same time, other spouses renounced their matrimonial relations and continued to live as spiritual siblings in their own pious households, which they slowly transformed into ascetic dwellings, or, rarely, fled elsewhere. Not all the monastic spouses founded new communities, but some of them either joined already existent monasteries, or, after years of living in proximity, they separated. This thesis analyzed them as part of the double gender family asceticism which was recognized and legitimized. In the secondary literature scholars have been using the terminus technicus “double monastery” almost indiscriminately, for all eras and for all the regions, with the meaning of a coenobitic establishment that hosted ascetic men and women in seclusion. Generally, the term was opposed to other types of double gender communities called “mixed monasteries,” “neighbor monasteries,” or “distant monasteries.” Literature published from the nineteenth century until today distinguished two main stages of research, one lasting until the beginning of the twentieth century, and another one which started at the end of the 1980s. In this period, two disciplines, history and Church law, have been dealing with the problem of double monasteries. The syntagm “double monastery” cannot be easily applied to the fourth-century context, since the terms “duplex monasterium” and “διπλοῦν μοναστήριον” are first attested in 546, in Justinian’s Novel 123, while sources never use the other terms proposed in scholarship. However, since in English no other syntagm is able to cover accurately the particularities of the fourth- and fifth-century communities that my dissertation scrutinizes, throughout my work I conventionally referred to them by adopting the formula “family double monasteries.” Several common conditions led to the gradual development of this model of monasticism. First, a charismatic ascetic man attached to his male monastery a community of pious women who followed him and he set up a set of rules which concerned both groups of ascetics and their interaction. In other instances, men and women relatives transformed their “pious households” into ascetic establishments. In this case, they did not cease to live in the same environment, but at a later stage in their evolution, groups of monks and nuns were secluded, and a set of rules established the legitimate contacts between them. Yet, in other situations, relatives founded a community for both monks and nuns in a different place than their household. Such a place attracted other ascetically oriented family members, creating ‘monastic networks.’ Finally, in some situations, spouses decided to renounce their family connections and to become ascetics. Sources describe several stages in the accomplishment of such a decision, which had noticeable consequences at the social level. The sources pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the communities which my thesis investigates are mostly written. The hagiographies, letters, monastic rules, dialogues, homilies, sermons, and poems have their specific set of rules which concern their production, audience, and way of dissemination. Most of the sources belong to more than one category, a fact which is not surprising for the fourth-century context. Moreover, all the texts have male authors, a detail which becomes essential when analyzing references to ascetic women.....",Degree: PhD,PDF file (1861k),ETD,CEU Doctoral School of History,,PhD

The research also seeks to examine the structural and process changes in the water sector as an aggregate mechanism of policies, legal and regulatory procedures, organizational structures, financing and impact mitigation mechanisms. The research is based on the mixed method approach with the application of several methodological tools. The major methodological components include ex-post benchmarking method, conversational/stakeholder interviewing, document analysis, and the household survey  bottom-up participatory approach that puts people at the core of the research. Research results show that intensive marketization trends with related structural changes reinforced privatization in public services. Conditional technical and financial support from donor institutions and urgency dictated by the deteriorating infrastructure made privatization a “no other option”. Even under the “forced” conditions, transition to the public-private provision of water services in Armenia had a positive influence on the sustainability performance of all water utilities. Armenian utilities also succeed in performing well internationally. However, the scale of impact of privatization depends on the initial state of the enterprise and the local context. Supportive legislation and regulation is needed for ensuring the attractiveness and incentives for the private sector participation and operation and for protecting consumers from monopoly abuse. Furthermore, although water supply services have been improved and people are generally satisfied with water services, there are still a number of service deficiencies that households face and try to cope with by implementing a number of measures that require additional costs and/or behavioural changes. Finally, after the high return and low risk low hanging fruits are reached during the first generation reforms to meet the most urgent needs, more efforts are required for enhancing long-term sustainability and effectiveness.",Water supply -- Armenia,,PhD

The regimes with concentrated power are believed to be particularly dangerous for the states with deep ethnic cleavages. This latter concern is a question of great importance for the post-Soviet region, because since the collapse of the Soviet Union some of the multi-ethnic post-Soviet states had the experience of both ethnic conflicts and concentration of power. Consequently, the main goal of this research is to determine whether power concentration encourages the escalation of ethnic conflicts. For this, I explore three mechanisms that may link the degree of power concentration with ethnic minorities’ mobilization against the state: identity-related state policies, electoral rules, and centralization. The empirical investigation is built on the analysis of three post-Soviet cases – Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine – based on the structured focused comparison technique. The data presented in this research reveal that the highest level of ethnic minorities’ mobilization against the state in the three post-Soviet republics occurred in periods with dispersed power, and not in periods with concentrated power. The research further shows that contrary to the common expectation, the reason for this was not the presumed suppressive character of concentrationist regimes over ethnic groups as citizens. Instead, the incumbent elites in the periods with power concentration combined minorities’ cooptation in central and local power with the enhanced control over the regional elite formation and regional access to financial resources, and in some cases, with a gradual de-politization of societal multi-ethnicity. Specifically, the leadership of concentrationist regimes tended to increase the threshold for accessing power through electoral rules with disproportional elements, which prevented the consolidation of ethnic parties and at the same time attracted minority leaders to the ruling parties. In addition, concentration of power tended to augment territorial centralization. This implied an increased control by central level political incumbents over the financial, administrative, and political affairs at regional level, which reduced local potential mobilizers’ access to mobilization resources. Finally, as the leadership of power concentration tended to implement integrationist rather than accommodationist policies towards minorities, this de-emphasized the political importance of multi-ethnicity.  The research concludes that at least in the three cases included in the analysis, concentration of power did not trigger, but it rather discouraged ethnic mobilization against the state, due to its intrinsic tendencies to increase the threshold for access to power of potential challengers and also to co-opt minority leaders, to strengthen centralization of power, and to de-politicize ethnicity. Hence, the success of concentrationist regimes in reducing minorities’ mobilization against the state did not consist in suppressing ethnic groups as citizens, but in hindering the formation of a self-standing ethnic minority elite. Therefore, if power concentration is to be avoided in the post-Soviet region, it should be for other reasons than for fear of ethnic instability.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (5258k),"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD

It examines the dynamics of EU interventions in conflicts, asking: Why and under what conditions does the EU decide to get involved in conflict resolution? In a conflict-prone world and competing security priorities, what determines EU involvement in particular conflicts? Do supranational institutions, such as the European Commission and the EU Council Secretariat, matter in initiating, shaping and implementing EU policies on conflict resolution? To answer these questions, I use institutionalist and intergovernmentalist theories to assess their relative explanatory power in accounting for the patterns of EU interventions in conflict. I find that these approaches are broadly complementary: institutionalism explains EU interventions in the low-politics areas of conflict resolution, while intergovernmentalism explains EU behaviour in the high-politics areas of intervention. When it comes to intervention in conflicts, EU foreign policy is like a light airplane: it can fly without being caught on radar as long as it flies ‘low’. By flying low (and slow), such an airplane can advance quite far into ‘enemy’ territory. However, if it increases its altitude above a certain threshold, it risks being detected by radars, and actions may be taken to halt the aircraft. The same holds true for EU interventions in conflicts. To avoid challenging EU member states, EU institutions often employ stealth intervention, operating predominantly in uncontroversial and depoliticised aspects of conflict resolution. By “flying low,” they are thus able to gradually extend their mandate from low-politics areas of conflict resolution to the high politics realm of overt intervention. Using a strategy I call “dosage”, EU institutions engage in a series of low-cost actions, which, over a longer period of time, can yield significant cumulated policy impact. However, if their involvement becomes suddenly controversial, as when EU institutions enter suddenly into the realm of high-politics, EU member states may move to limit their autonomy.  The dissertation traces the politics of stealth intervention by EU institutions using unpublished empirical data related to the EU decision-making process as well as interactions between the EU institutions, EU member states, and Russia in the conflict zones in question.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (306k),ETD,European Union -- Former Soviet republics,,PhD

It aims to explain how we got to the point, in which this way of doing business, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurship” in Berlin, became capable of being discussed and regarded as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. What is at stake is the discontinuity - acceptance of “ethnic entrepreneurship” - rather than trying to fit this singular event into a “natural flow of history”. This does not mean that it sets up chance over plans or principles in the interpretation of history. Rather, it intends to demonstrate that it was not self-evident that “ethnic entrepreneurship” as such had been accepted, defined and still has been discussed as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. Hence, I look at the conditions of possibility by seeking out once again the links, which at a particular moment shape the self-evident. Deriving from these goals, the dissertation falls into two parts. In the first part (genealogical), I concentrate on the historical features of “ethnic entrepreneurship” and examine conditions of possibility in Berlin under the context of Germany and its regional and global relatedness through the rationalities and imaginations of policy makers, experts and intellectuals. In the second part (anthropological), I explore first, the ways individuals perform themselves as “ethnic entrepreneurs”; second, rules for this way doing things; and third, truth claims (as sphere where true and false can be carried out) for providing reasons about this way of doing things.  Within this structure, the contribution of this dissertation can be drawn from its objective: to challenge the binary opposition that emerges through the ways of thinking about “ethnic entrepreneurship”. This binary opposition is between the pre-given or essentialist understanding of culture and the “welcoming” understanding of diverse cultural co-existence. The former, associating a space with a pre-given identity and considering its existence as natural, underlines particular ways of doing businesses by “ethnic entrepreneurs”. The latter, acknowledging socially embeddedness of these economic agents in laws, institutions and social networks, “welcomes” their richness, potential and competence in doing business with the concepts like “transcultural”, “multicultural” and “cosmopolitan”. As a result of this relation, one enters a domain, where conflicting true and false discourses can be produced and re-produced in a continuous manner through exclusive (the former) and inclusive (the latter) formulations of culture. It is this binary opposition that I aim to challenge, since both of these approaches function as mechanisms of othering. By pursuing this goal, the dissertation illustrates how human beings have been turned into subjects, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurs”.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2556k),ETD,Unrestricted,Turks -- Germany,,PhD

For Aristotle phantasia is a motion of the perceptive soul that makes possible a great amount of activities and higher cognitions beyond sense-perception. Phantasia became a fundamental psychological concept in the Hellenistic Era: in empiricist epistemology, in action theory as perceptual representation of the external world; in aesthetics as creative imagination. I argue that Alexander proceeds from an Aristotelian framework of parts and capacities of the soul, but unlike Aristotle, he distinguishes a distinct capacity for phantasia. The main reason for this comes from his polemic against the Stoics: they do not acknowledge an activity of phantasia. A distinct activity requires a distinct object, which in turn a distinct capacity. The distinct status of a phantasia-capacity in itself modifies the architecture of the soul in comparison with Aristotle. But in addition Alexander makes important changes in the framework: he makes capacities as basic (and rather modular), and parts and the soul as sets of capacities. The object of phantasia is the residue from perception in activity. The status of this as internal object needs clarification. I show that it is internal on account of being a physical process in the body. Again, I argue that it is the causal object of phantasia: it is the item that provides content to the phantasia-activity by triggering it. But the residue is not an intentional object: it is a representation of something else. I give a reconstruction of Alexander`s account how the residue may be representation. Accordingly, it is a representation in virtue of preserving fully a perceptual content (something that had been perceived); or in virtue of functioning as an equivalent of a fully preserved residue insofar as phantasia completed an incompletely preserved residue. The latter case explains a wide range of cases, in general the fact that phantasia is more prone to error than perception. Finally I analyse the activity of phantasia. I argue that its content is propositional, in particular it is ‘S is P’: a predication of a perceptible feature P of a thing that caused a perception S. First, I show that it is implausible to construe simple cases of phantasia (or perception: for perception has the same type of content as phantasia) as non-propositional, demonstrating that the object reading of the content (x sees ‘white’) is inadequate in that at the best it reduces to existential propositions (‘there is white’). Again, I analyse two positive evidences. (1) Alexander`s account of the truth-conditions of phantasia implies propositional content: phantasia is about an existent thing, S; and it is such as the thing, P. (2) The account of simultaneous perception (of several perceptibles) entails propositional content, and even uses examples as ‘this is white’. The phantasia-activity is said to be krisis, which I take to be judgement: primarily because its content is propositional. I argue that it is a certain type of judgement, perceptual, in contrast to conceptual judgements of the rational soul-part: esp. opinion. However, phantasia-judgement may be distinguished from perceptual judgement only because they are concerned with different objects: internal vs. external.",Degree: PhD,,Aristotle,,PhD

These ideas are rehearsed against the theoretical backdrop of Leo Bersani’s and Lee Edelman’s antirelational queer theory, José Estaban Muñoz’s work on queer potentiality, relationality and hope as articulated in Cruising Utopia in opposition to antiutopian antirelationality, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s affective turn (in particular her theorizing on shame and her concept of paranoid and reparative reading). The analyses in the first two chapters gesture toward a displacement of antirelational queer theory’s overinvestment in the radicality of strategically embracing cultural fantasies of male homosexuality as psychic negativity or erotic self-annihiliation. In contrast to these tropes, a vision of queer relationality grounded in the relational dynamics of shame is forwarded, drawing on Sedgwick’s work on shame inspired by Silvan Tomkins’s affect theory. The shy queer man thus comes to figure as a counterpoint to the death-driven queer subject enraptured by jouissance. The third chapter, in turn, moves from such a contrastive “anti-antirelational” engagement to a closer exploration of Tomkins’s theory of shame, combining it with phenomenological film theory and Sara Ahmed’s work on queer phenomenology, arguing that the short film’s climactic moment allows us to think shame as utopian potentiality as conceived by Muñoz. Finally, the conclusion suggests a conception of shame as reparative affect in contrast to routinized habits of thought in paranoid antirelational queer theory.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

This is done by assessing the impact of National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) prosecution in two forms – the announcement of investigations and the announcement of the final sentence – on favouritism in local public procurement. Based on 1.4 million public procurement contracts, Propensity Score Matching is employed to estimate the Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATTs) and the Conditional Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (CATTs) for Romanian localities affected by DNA prosecution concerning a composite risk score based on three red flags in the tendering process and a market domination indicator. The data reveals that the theoretical predictions cannot be confirmed. These findings may suggest that systemic corruption requires a more comprehensive approach which goes beyond currently predominant policies.",,PDF file (1209k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

However, the effects of that phenomenon around the issue of climate change among the public on the EU energy policy remain under-researched. In order to establish the link between the two, the thesis applies the neofunctionalist EU integration framework, which claims that politicization of an issue leads to further policy integration of that topic. Previous research has noted that politicization of climate change has been underway in individual countries, however, the current thesis establishes, based on opinion polls and European Parliament election results, that this process has also occurred in the EU as all three criteria of politicization (increase in the salience, polarization of opinion and mobilization of public opinion) have increased over the last few years. Regarding energy policy, the thesis demonstrates that the deepening of energy policy integration has increased significantly, especially in the form of bottom-up pressure, thereby ’bringing politics’ into energy policy. Based on the neofunctionalist conceptual frame, the thesis concludes that the increased politicization of climate change among the public has fueled energy policy integration in the EU, becoming the main driver behind it and replacing thus the earlier driver of the Energy Union – energy security.

I argue that this is an oversimplification. Knowledge can be partially rival and excludable, and companies routinely use secrecy to mitigate the risk of knowledge disclosure. The path of an invention from an inventor to general knowledge is far from straightforward, influenced by many factors including institutional interventions such as patents. I introduce a new property of permanency—the inability to reverse transactions with a good—to analyze how knowledge becomes a public good. To show the effects of permanency empirically, I use assignment data on over four million US patents to test the hypothesis that patents on relatively less reverse-engineerable inventions will more likely be reassigned sooner after the application date. The results of a logistic and survival regression support this hypothesis, which suggests that permanency plays a role in motivations of inventors and companies to patent. Future research on knowledge creation and disclosure and policy proposals for patent reforms thus should employ a more nuanced conceptualization of knowledge, in which permanency plays a role.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1563k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

This research is answering the question why, despite the existing legacy of federative relations with the substantial level of decentralization and accountability with democratic traditions German regions does not show good budgetary performance, whereas in the absence of historical legacy and accountability mechanisms and with the high level of political centralization in Russia, it is possible to create system with the better budgetary performance. The hypothesis of this research was that indeed, the historical heritage and democratic rules increase the level of decentralization and accountability, but this does not necessarily lead to better budgetary performance because of the weak budgetary constraints and incentives. The results of this study approve this hypothesis. Tested by crisp-set Qualitative Comparative analysis this research shows several important tendencies. Despite of the historical roots, federal legacy and democratic type of regime leading to a greater level of decentralization, budgetary performance is not a direct consequence of such a system. With a relatively high level of decentralization, many of Germany's decentralization mechanisms work towards a worse performance. In particular, a strong level of fiscal decentralization, a lack of transparent budgetary allocation mechanisms (which are mainly related to the type of parliamentary political system), and a large number of equalizing federal transfers together with an uncontrolled regional opportunity to borrow money lead to a worse budgetary performance in that country. On the other hand, a more centralized system with lower level of accountability more often shows the better results in terms of budgetary performance, although some centralization tendencies (primarily political ones) do not contribute to the best level of budgetary indicators. Thus, the main conclusion of this work that hard budget constraints together with transparent responsibilities division allow a higher level of budgetary performance in Russia and Germany.

The state border between Belarus and Lithuania, in many of its parts inhabited by Polish population from both sides, constitutes a distinctive example of a restricted geopolitical border – the external one of the EU – that replaced clearly formal and not corresponding to any existed cultural division – yet not inconsequential – administrative line from the Soviet times. The local effect of the state-work in the production of estrangement is examined in the thesis, as well as the circulating notions of the meaning(lessness) of the border. One scrutinised dimension of this process is the emotional experience of the factual separation, established by restrictive visa regimes and border control. On the other hand, emotional modalities, through which personal experiences of the divide are expressed, are tightly interconnected with ‘the sense of border’ at its ideational level. This, in turn, leads to further exploration of the dynamics of the popular conceptualisation of the emerged difference, expressed through the vocabulary of ‘civilizational’ and geopolitical meanings produced by the states and utilised by popular political imagination.

The main question of the thesis is how the organization of production specific to UpWork, as well as locally conditioned market positions and structural differences of freelancers, shape the relations within this network. Firstly, I analyse how the value chains span into the network through re-outsourcing of work between freelancers and enable value capture for individual freelancers. Those who outsource act as suppliers in the value chains and depend on trust relations with their subcontractors, while those subcontractors who are in weak structural positions both on the platform and domestic labour market depend on them for access to jobs and platform reputation. Secondly, I show how the network is utilized for learning, as well as social and emotional support. As freelancers act as fragmented suppliers of which majority is in extremely precarious positions and acts mostly as a labour reserve army, these processes are needed for their further engagement in the market. Furthermore, due to structural constraints, this network lacks capacities for political organization and it serves primarily individuals to compete within these value chains. Thus, the processes of value creation and capture, learning and cooperation, as well as relational work, which are regularly integrated into firm value chains, are in the case of platform outsourcing dispersed and decentralized throughout the freelance networks constructed from the bottom-up.",Degree: MA,PDF file (1015k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

The common feature of political science literature related to a social network is that they mostly focus on whether the individuals’ political views and their social networks co-evolve or not. According to the recent literature, social networks do not simply evolve but also stimulate our political behavior. Most of the literature finds that people seek individuals with similar political views to be friends with and individuals who often talk to each other tend to be more similar over time Although there is broad agreement on that while our social network is dynamically flourishing, it is also affecting our attitude, but the process of this impact is still not clear.

CSR – a by-product of the broader neoliberal regime of governmentality – by redefining the boundaries between public and private, invests firms with political authority while at the same time reinventing their social role in a way that the resulting system of governance ultimately both governs through and consists of the very success of its discourse in the global economy.",Degree: MA,PDF file (682k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Using a comparative methodology, the research describes how the regulation of social networking platforms in relation to hate speech is being approached by the Council of Europe, German, the United States of America and Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. It tests the hypothesis that legal frameworks for moderation of user-generated online content can have a more detrimental effect for freedom of speech in semi-democratic countries like Ethiopia than in developed liberal democracies. Findings of this project regarding the recently enacted Ethiopian Hate Speech and Disinformation Prevention proclamation will offer some guidance for The Council of Ministers in the course of adopting implementing regulation.",Degree: MA,PDF file (776k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

The proposal is viewed as part of an expanding array of mechanisms aimed at guaranteeing victims rights. I ground the proposal in an understanding of the goals of transitional justice, and the alternative measures available to meet these goals. Coming to a final verdict in an international criminal trial is an important step toward meeting transitional justice goals including the utilitarian and retributive goals achieved through ruling on liability, and symbolic justice for victims. In general, trial in absentia is viewed as acceptable by international and regional human rights courts if safeguards are met. Different international tribunals have approached trial in absentia with varying degrees of tolerance. This thesis examines international and regional standards surrounding trial in absentia, including case-law from the Human Rights Committee (HRC), International Criminal Court (ICC), International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and concludes that partial in absentia trials will likely continue to be permitted in international law. This thesis devotes a separate chapter to analysis of trial in absentia at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the Statutes of which explicitly allow for proceedings in the absence of the defendant. Despite the strong tradition dictating that a trial should end upon the death of defendant, legal theory and precedent shows that international criminal law allows for some procedural flexibility in favor victim’s rights, due to the gravity of international core crimes and the sui generis nature of international tribunals. In order to establish guidelines surrounding when flexibility can occur, this thesis examines international law in the frame of Packer’s two models, as well as the work of Damaska and Megrét, and case-law from the European Court of Human Rights. The thesis concludes by examining how trial in absentia—usually resulting from the flight of the defendant, the defendant’s refusal to appear at his or her trial, the defendant’s disruption of the courtroom, or serious medical needs of the defendant—can apply to cases where the defendant has died, without violating human rights norms. This thesis ultimately advocates for the adoption of a waiver system in which the defendant may agree to the continuation of his or her trial after death.",Degree: MA,PDF file (666k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

What were the migration-related issues encountered by the women in dealing with the Philippine and Hungarian governments? What are the challenges of living and working in Hungary, and how do Filipina migrant workers address them? How does identity figure in these challenges and the women’s responses to them? In making the above inquiries, the thesis not only broadens the discussion on Filipinas employed abroad in terms of occupation and geographical location, but also challenges essentialist narratives in existing literature on women OFWs. The research was enriched by drawing on the accounts of ten women OFWs in Hungary of different ages, civil status, occupations, and socio-economic backgrounds, with a view to find out as much as possible about their motivations and aspirations. This is important because studies or articles on women OFWs need to account for diverse jobs, personalities, individual circumstances leading to migration, and lived experiences that go beyond abuse, exploitation, or violence to have a fuller view of the women’s complexities.  In order to analyze the information gathered from the women interviewees, a Feminist Global Political Economy (GPE) framework was used. This framework utilizes the feminist perspective to examine the situation of the women OFWs within the global political economy, which involves different actors and elaborate domestic-international, private-public, local-global, and south-north interactions. Concepts from intersectional and post-colonial theories were also incorporated to account for intersecting gender, race, and class identities of Filipinas as women of color, Asians, and “Third World women.”  The thesis will show that “Filipinas” and “overseas Filipina workers” are not homogeneous categories and they have various reasons for leaving the Philippines and residing in Hungary, as well as various ways of responding to challenges posed by transnational labor migration. The women OFWs contend with restrictive state power in the form of regulated entry, residence, and exit, along with the discourse of the Philippine government that constructs them as objects that are naturally meant to be marketed as overseas labor. Filipinas in Hungary deal with gendered and racialized notions of who they are as women, workers, and partners. They also encounter racism and issues with migration and employment. However, In the milieu of neoliberal globalization where state and transnational business interests prevail, the women have had to rely on themselves and their informal networks for survival and development given the lack of support or services offered by the Philippine and Hungarian governments.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Passing through covering emerges as the main strategy both among socially mobile and immobile Tuzcu Roma. When they draw on only iterational elements of stigmatized habitual dispositions, strategies are not successful. On the other hand, effective passing strategies through covering stem from cleft habitus of Tuzcu Roma which make use of projective and practical-evaluative element of the agentic dimension.

The crisis had resulted in the intensification of the migration discourse that was never seen before in the country. A part of this intensification was a strong state campaign that has been built on the crisis: a nationalist and hegemonic rhetoric which was rejective and hostile towards migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. This propaganda spoke about migratory processes in the framework of securitization where the process was understood and mobilized as a threat to the European-Christian culture. This narrative was not only rhetorically but visually outstanding. State financed posters and advertisements represented “the migrant” as a voiceless, faceless, male, violent, dark-skinned person who is not even an individual but exists in a horde-like group of people. Besides of this xenophobic and hostile context, counter-hegemonic narratives emerged not just in the form of social movements but, as I argue, in the artistic-visual field too. In my thesis, I focus on this contemporary counter-discourse of the Hungarian cinema through the lenses of three movies which have a privileged position in the “migration movie” corpus in Hungary, not only because all of them was funded by the state but because they earned nationwide recognition. These movies are The Citizen (2016), Jupiter’s Moon (2017) and Easy Lessons (2018). The first part of my research would like to contextualize these movies with special regard to their socio-political and cultural context. For this, I carry out discourse analysis on the already existing literature. After, I make the analysis of the movies themselves to explore the place of them in the discourse on visual representation and migration after 2015. The main questions of the analysis are how these movies are the part of the counter-discourse, what are those circumstances by the dominant state discourse that could challenge free artistic expression, and in which ways aesthetic and political elements are intertwined in the visual language of these movies. The research would like to answer these questions through the politics of (in)visibility and those artistic instruments that aim to transform the unseen “Other” into visible. Therefore the thesis displays two competing visual attitudes towards the representation of migration: one by the neo-authoritarian state propaganda and another by the contemporary Hungarian cinema.",Degree: MA,PDF file (430k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Findings showed that there are several reasons for the differing outcomes. Cape Town faced several challenges that Israel did not, such as the Apartheid and severe poverty; however, it seems that the challenges Israel did face -- such as large immigration waves and settling the desert made Israel’s water sector more resilient overall. This was thanks to the development of management practices such as supply augmentation via large-scale seawater desalination, utilizing treated wastewater, developing efficient agriculture technologies.

This manuscript, written by Mihail Slavopulos in 1292, shows a specific form of organization which distinguishes it from other Heirmologia of the same period. Moreover, the arrangement of the odes within an Akolouthia (service) seems to be a form of ‘deviance’ from the traditional Heirmologia.

A detailed examination is made on a repertory of liturgical chants in Mode I – text and neumatic notation - which is common for the three manuscripts.

In my thesis, I argue that, in principle, statistical evidence can be a basis for knowledge and conviction, and there is no rationale for discriminating against statistical evidence; the intuitive difference between non-statistical and statistical evidence is merely psychological and can be understood in the light of consideration like the historical development of our intuitions. * * * First, I suggest some scenarios in which the belief is based on statistical evidence yet, according to the criteria from many accounts of knowledge in the market for knowledge. To extend knowledge assignment to even more cases of statistical evidence, I apply a famous distinction from Wilfrid Sellars between ‘manifest image’ and ‘scientific image’ of the world and ourselves to the case of knowledge; I enumerate some of the problems with the intuitive notion of knowledge, discuss some historical considerations to better understand such intuitive reactions and, briefly, explore the possibility of a move towards a more scientific notion of knowledge which not only allows knowledge assignment to many cases with statistical evidence but also can help with addressing some long-lasting issues in epistemology.  Then, I turn to a parallel issue with statistical evidence in the context of legal cases. Discussing three proposals to distinguish the non-statistical and statistical evidence, I argue that none of them manages to provide an independent rationale for such discrimination.  Finally, I address some worries about the reliability of the current statistical methods that are used to produce statistical evidence as well as some concerns regarding the applicability of statistical methods to particular cases and propose some criteria that can help to decide whether a piece of statistical evidence is relevant and can be used as a basis for judgment in each scenario.",Degree: MA,PDF file (728k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

In the theoretical framework of the first chapter, I will provide the reader with a genealogy of the category of human by focusing on the canonical patriarchal understanding of the rational man in Western philosophy, while also addressing the category of human species, so as to illustrate how these approaches formulated research in Artificial Intelligence. In the second chapter, I will provide a close reading analysis of Michel Foucault and Brian Massumi’s scholarship that bridges biopower and capitalism to the affect and the body’s materiality. Based on this, I will read the trope of emotionality used in Sophia’s case in relation to the modulation of affect in late capitalism. This way, I intend to illustrate how Sophia is imbedded in a much more nuanced web of relations of power, one that redefines the boundaries between who is included in the category of the human species and who is not. In the third chapter, by employing Michel Foucault’s analysis on biopower while also engaging with Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis I will draw attention to the discursive traces that construct Sophia’s identity in accordance to the biopolitical technologies of race and sexuality. Finally, in last chapter, drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s analysis on the abstract machine of faciality and Judith Butler’s approach on drag I will reflect on the constructiveness of the boundaries between the human and the non-human, to argue that Sophia is not just a product of her time but also a point of disruption that might unravel what Deleuze and Guattari call, the inhuman in the human.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Such general process, defined by a departure from exclusively institutional religious worldviews towards more diverse ones, is in tune with what occurs at the latin american/regional and local levels; and yet at the same time it’s also far from being homogeneous to all social realities in which it takes place, as the Peruvian case provides also with examples. Given this contrasting relationship between the local and the global, it is worth questioning as to what is the cause (or causes) attributable for these shared differences in form, but not in content. In the present thesis, I will address this question in arguing that religious socialization experiences, in the form of Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs onwards), are one of the main conditioners for shaping contemporary Peruvian religious and secular worldviews. CREDs are related to instances of observable behavior from an individual’s peers that generate an impact on them, based on how they act accordingly to what is stipulated in their respective religious belief systems or expressed religious convictions. In turn and over time, different CREDs will allow for the acquisition, maintenance or relegation of religious belief and their negotiations, which give rise to diversified worldviews.  For this purpose, I have placed as unit of analysis the age group of Peruvian young adults, (18-29 y.o.) all of them being university students located in Lima-Peru, since, as it will be argued, Peruvian youth within this age group experiences religious socialization in differentiated ways to previous generations, namely, in their general socialization experiences; in the accessing of novel media elements; in the engagement of social movements; and, in the adoption of a consumer ethos.  An interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological approach will be the basis for the elaboration of the argument, in which concepts from the fields of Cognitive Science of Religion and Sociology (in the form of theories of religious socialization) will serve as analytical tools; while grounded techniques based on Q-methodology have been used for the data gathering process of 320 surveys, 43 q-sorts, and 43 structured interviews. As a result of this exploration, a preliminary proposal of ideal-type models of religious and secular worldviews will be outlined.

It sheds a new light on how the magazine is used as a platform for opening the questions on discrimination, poverty and mental health issues not discussed in the mainstream media. As such, the magazine serves as a tool for subversive social activism. However, this research also shows that despite the often radical rhetoric, the magazine still implies neoliberal work ethic on its vendors. The interviews with the magazine employees uncover troubling situation with the state institutions and the collapse of the safety net, and the attempts that the magazine is doing to offer support to its vendors. Such support often goes beyond a basic selling training, taking the role of the missing state institutions particularly regarding various trainings for job search and mental health support. Finally, the interviews with the vendors question the market model imposed on them, and ideas of sale efficiency as a mean to improve their social condition during the post-socialist transformation.

I then discuss the homonormative politics of the Madison LGBTQ+ community, and contrast them with an analysis of Queer Pressure’s political commitments. The final section of this chapter is a case study of the No Cops at Pride movement, reactions to and consequences of its engagement with radical queer politics, and a brief analysis of the resonance of this movement in 2018 with the racial justice mass movement of 2020. Ultimately, I do not strive to make any overarching conclusions with this thesis, but rather to take seriously and consider deeply a particular moment in time in the place that I consider home, and to gesture towards a more complex engagement with the queer spaces that exists in between the rural and the urban in the United States.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

In this regard a growing field of interest is the quantification of PA ecological effectiveness, often expressed in terms of avoided deforestation achieved relative to unprotected areas. However, such assessments are confounded by biases in both the non-random siting of PAs within landscapes as well as differential pressure upon their resources. These biases can be overcome by the use of quasi-experimental counterfactual study designs, that evaluate the impact of PAs against control areas of ‘similar’ biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. To contribute towards this knowledge domain this study presents an assessment of PA effectiveness for the Southeast Asian nation Cambodia, which, in light of its history of natural resource management, represents a pertinent case study. PA effectiveness was analysed using propensity score matching for three different outcome periods between 2010-2018 with the results finding significant positive treatment effects in each, with forested land in PAs being as much as 8% less likely to be deforested than similar unprotected forest. In addition to this a significant positive spillover effect of PAs was observed in 5km buffers zones adjacent to their boundaries, resulting in a maximum of 4% reduction in probability of deforestation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of PAs in Cambodia was found to vary under differential deforestation pressure as well as with regards to the duration of time since PA establishment.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (6599k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

This act eliminated discrimination against certain ethnic groups that had persisted since the Immigration Act of 1924 which established the National Origins Formula. Under the National Origins Formula, immigration quotas were put into place in order to limit the number of immigrants from regions of the world that would negatively alter the ethnic distribution of the United States. The era within which the Hart-Celler Act was passed was one of a great change in the psyche of the U.S. demos towards a more liberal, global way of thinking by removing these quotas and creating a better system through which residency could be acquired. The changing of times and inability to address it since, however, has led to immigration becoming a forefront of political debate in the United States today. This has culminated in the presidential campaign and subsequent election of Donald J. Trump, whose primary campaign issue revolved around racially charged sentiments and the problems of immigration. My aim here is to assess, from relevant data and evidence, the impact of the Hart-Celler Act by examining a) how it improved or faulted as legislation upon its predecessor – via reallocation of immigration slots from Northern Europe to 3rd world inhabitants or the creation of chain migration – and b) the economic and social consequences that have occurred in the fifty years following. I shall follow this up by developing a normative scale upon which to judge the competing immigration theories, which is succeeded by taking a look at philosophical literature in search of providing a clearer picture regarding the moral debate surrounding immigration today. I conclude a) that Congress passed a law improving on many of the shortcomings of its predecessor, though it has not been spared criticism on pragmatic grounds; and b) that the legislative changes cultivated fairly positive economic consequences. Additionally, I assert that sole adherence to either theory of immigration is too narrow in approaching the problem of reform and that collaborative measures that are understanding of both sides’ interpretations of justice is the most suitable path forward.",,PDF file (924k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

This paper suggests that Dugin’s theory constitutes a genuine and unique example of Right-Heideggerianism and expands on the ideas of conservative revolutionaries through incorporating the major theoretical developments of the 20th century. It is demonstrated that identifying the key premise of Dugin’s approach to political philosophy as the insistence on the ontological primacy of community in relation to the construction of the human self, envisioned in Heideggerian terms, allows for Dugin’s political application of Heidegger’s fundamental ontology to be both sufficiently distinct from present currents in political thought, and flexible to be appropriated as a new conceptual foundation by a wide array of radical conservative and right-wing movements.",,PDF file (884k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

O’Connor and Kenter’s Life Framework of Values (LFV) is an innovative and comprehensible means to communicate intrinsic and relational values, which are conceived of as related to living with, from, in and as the more-than-human world. The LFV seeks to operationalize intrinsic values in the context of conservation and sustainability. This thesis brings perspectives from Latour and Haraway to bear on environmental ethics discussions, especially around intrinsic and relational values. The work of Latour and Haraway expands the understanding of the more-than-human world, examines conceptions of nature and wilderness, looks at nature/culture interaction and proposes the inclusion of the Gaia and the Anthropocene as essential conceptual frameworks. Latour and Haraway’s work on relationality provides insight into the LFV. Latour’s actor-network theory increases the range of entities and objects that participate in networks and gives these actors greater agency. The concept of the Anthropocene means that relations between the human and the more-than-human have become central forces, and provides historical, political and economic background to the current ecological crisis. Acceptance of the Anthropocene and Gaia means that we exist in a limited critical zone. Latour and Haraway argue against universalizing ethical systems. Latour advocates ethical sensitization and Haraway argues for situated knowledge and attention to entanglement and injustice.

Instead of putting too much emphasis on drone warfare as the existing literature suggests, the more recent developments with the risk of eliminating humans from war-making should be addressed.

Today, nearly 2 billion people are active users of online markets. E-commerce, in its unique way, is the only borderless market and this feature makes its regulation highly complicated as of today, states are not able to agree on uniform set of rules that will govern the immense online market. The international nature of E-commerce constantly raises legal questions as the law struggles to catch up to a changing world. The non-geographical nature of E-commerce makes the traditional application of choice of law and jurisdiction rules difficult to apply, as these were designed for a pre internet age, based on connection factors, the strongest being geographical in nature. In E-commerce, it is highly complicated for the parties to identify the real location of the other as the transaction is based on informal declarations that are not all the time accurate, and even these geographical indicators can fail while talking about the contracts performed online. In order to ensure predictability and certainty in E-commerce transaction instead of using connecting geographical indicators it would be more useful to identify proper law and jurisdiction based on party autonomy. However even in this hypothesis it is highly probable that improper law and jurisdiction will be applicable. Such risk emerges because of unequal bargain power of the parties, E-businesses are usually assisted by professional lawyers that are able to design the terms of an E-contract in the favor of their clients. At the same time consumers are less likely to be aware about the meaning and consequences of such clauses as choice of law and choice of jurisdiction, furthermore they are not even able to negotiate the terms before agreeing to them. Hence validity and enforceability of these clauses are of a primary importance, especially because of the fast growing online market.

In conclusion, I will try to answer the more ambitious question: how the anti-immigrant mobilization affects European solidarity and identification with Europe as the common culture?

The response to the call for the demonstration was overwhelming and launched an 18-day sit-in within Tahrir Square in Cairo, as well as other sit-ins and demonstrations throughout Egypt and solidarity demonstrations in front of Egyptian embassies abroad, ultimately leading to deposing the former president Muhammad Husni Mubarak in February 2011. Between February 2011 and August 2013, a lifetime’s worth of violent and polarizing clashes and confrontations took place. The end result of these clashes and confrontations is the reinstatement of a military-led authoritarian regime that is cracking down on individual and collective liberties, enforcing harsh austerity measures under the guise of neo-liberal reform, and an increased sense of embitterment concerning living in Egypt. Within the experience of the Revolution, I investigate ‘revolutionary purity’ as a simultaneously powerful and ambiguous force, born out of an Arabic tradition of linking ‘Revolution’ and ‘Purity’ that influenced the trajectory of the Revolution in Egypt. By bringing together the life stories of active participants in the Revolution and my autoethnography as a witness of the Revolution from a distance, I argue that revolutionary purity came into being between the personal and the political; the revolutionaries’ personal aspirations and frustrations, and their unfolding modes of politicization throughout the lifetime of the Revolution.

Out of several branches of law affected by this concept, the research will focus primarily on structuring, i.e. on the choices of corporate vehicles for business operations and legal consequences that such choices brings with them. In addition, special attention will be paid to tax considerations of such options as they by default heavily affect both the choice of business vehicles and operations of private equity industry in general. The primary reason for making such analysis lies in the fact that up to date scholarly works on legal aspects of private equity in Serbia are essentially descriptive. They do not give the answer as to why private equity industry in the country has not made a substantial progress for more than a decade after its regulation. Nor do they establish a comparative model upon which the industry can look upon. In this research, it is suggested that the US system may serve as such model. For these purposes, it explores the characteristics of the US system and the options it offers. The thesis will conclude that having a choice between several business vehicles and tax treatments is beneficial for the development of private equity industry in a country. Notably, the system needs to provide the possibility for private equity funds and firms to operate as flexible entities that are also fiscally transparent. This conclusion outlines the need for the developing countries to constantly reexamine their approach when it comes to the legal treatment of private equity. Overall, the research shows that civil law systems have many lessons to adopt from the American experience with the regulation of private equity industry.

Limited evidence in the existing literature suggests that the Overview Effect – the cognitive shift in awareness experienced by astronauts as a result of seeing Earth from outer space – may contain much greater ecological dimensions than has been previously implied. Based on 14 first-hand interviews with astronauts, this study utilizes interpretive phenomenological analysis to qualitatively demonstrate that the Overview Effect has a distinct ecological significance that results in positive changes to astronauts’ environmental attitudes and behaviours. Besides this change, the results qualitatively map the breadth and depth of astronauts’ present environmental attitudes and behaviours, which has also not been done prior to this study. The outer space perspective of Earth, which includes negative perceptual views of anthropogenic ecological destruction on the surface of the planet, is shown to add a new and additional element to environmentalism, and as such discourse analysis is used to demonstrate how the ecological impulse concept is useful for advancing theoretical formulations of how spaceflight affects environmental attitudes. Furthermore, an expanded definition of the astroenvironmentalism concept is proposed to encapsulate this distinct form of environmentalism, to facilitate more straightforward discussions on the topic, and to make this phenomenon and form of environmentalism more relevant and accessible to a wider audience.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (1581k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Recently, a smart solar off-grid system has been developed in Dharnai village in Bihar with the assistance of Greenpeace India. The aim of the thesis was to investigate and identify drivers and barriers to the growth of the solar off-grid system in Dharnai, fill the knowledge gap about the solar off-grid sector, and provide recommendations to improve the sector in the state. Data collected from interviews and focus group discussion in Dharnai was analyzed using Painuly’s (2001) framework. The findings suggested that significant drivers are unmet demands of consumers, policy ambitions, consumer’s capacity and willingness to pay, benefits of solar perceived by consumers, an indicator of development, and uncertainty about the grid connection. Furthermore, significant barriers to the growth of solar off-grid systems are policy loopholes, unmet demands of consumers, consumer’s affordability, and lack of financing options. The thesis recommends that the Bihar government should start awareness campaigns to improve consumer’s lack of awareness about the benefits of solar off-grid systems; make grid expansion predictable so that consumers have clarity about its timeline; take appropriate measures to improve financing and overall affordability of the consumers.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (1571k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Time as a resource, reflecting the power relations, is distributed unequally within the groups of people, with some spending most of the time working to ensure survival, while others are enjoying vast amounts of discretionary time. In contemporary society, the lack of time is especially acute in the lives of working mothers. The persistent essentialist understanding of motherhood still requires women to devote most of their time beyond paid employment to caregiving, and the standard working hours not taking the time needed for care responsibilities into account. This thesis explores the time poverty experienced by working mothers in Georgia who, due to unregulated working hours and the demands of motherhood, enjoy little to no temporal autonomy. The aim of the research is to analyze the perceptions of time for them and study the ways in which they distribute their time between paid labor, unpaid labor, and leisure and the reasoning behind this arrangement. I argue that the perception of time for working mothers in Georgia, shaped by the essentialist understanding of motherhood, is malleable and adaptable to immediate circumstances, different from the rigidity of capitalist temporality. The data collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews suggest that women perceive time poverty as their individual problem instead of questioning structural inequality leading to this condition; respondents assume that they have more control over their time than they actually do. Over the years, they have adopted different time management and time-saving strategies in order to utilize their time beyond paid employment and meet the contradictory standards of a good employee and a good mother. For this, they often have to juggle several tasks at a time, seek paid or unpaid help from other females, sacrifice their professional growth and leisure time, and put extensive effort into scheduling every minute of their days.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

The response and claims being made by these parties will be historically, institutionally, and politically contextualized. In order to do so I will utilize the discourse historical approach of critical discourse analysis and process tracing. In light of this analysis, I argue that the Hungarian Fidesz party, with Orbán at its helm, has engaged in the social creativity strategy of identity management and created a new claim on Christian Democracy. This claim combines nationalism, populism, and civilizationism, wherein the “Christian” component of Christian Democracy is central. The German Christian Democratic Union, headed by Angela Merkel has made no such grand ideological claims but rather has been characterized by caution, pragmatism and centrism. Even while refusing to backdown rhetorically from a defense of the rights of asylum seekers and the responsibility of Germany, and the EU more broadly, to help, their policy making reflected collaboration, cooperation, and concession on these principles. The Austrian People’s Party engages in both approaches, fluctuating between the two without overindulging in either. The approach this paper takes, and the examples put forth by these parties can be utilized to investigate trends in other Christian Democratic parties, or even other party families, in the wake of major events.

While current labor studies focus mostly on the impact of neoliberalization on labor, this thesis demonstrates that experiences of workers, engaged in cultural production in authoritarian states, are conditioned by the state’s endeavor at reproduction of symbolic order and marginalization of those in conflict with the hegemonic state project as well. For this reason, labor of journalists under authoritarian neoliberal regime is characterized as “politically” and “economically” precarious, and these two dimensions of precarity are closely intertwined. Journalists simultaneously face lack of stable contracts, employment insecurity, menace of media outlets being shut-down and even life threat. This research discusses how independent journalists in Russia experience and articulate these insecurities, related to specific economic and political contexts in which their labor is placed. The thesis demonstrates that political dimension of precarity, engendered by the authoritarian regime, is treated by journalists as the most problematic, whereas economic insecurities, albeit solidly present, tend to be ignored. Among the reasons for non- acknowledgement of the economic dimension of precarity are specific understanding of labor journalists share, their liberal ideologies, strong affective bindings to a job, widespread among cultural workers, and privileged class positions.

Two dominant narratives have been established: that of the European aspirational ideal and of the Albanian ethno-national invocation of masculine war heroes and freedom fighters. Sexual violence – and victimhood in general – did not fit into these state narratives, further impacting policy priorities. In parallel with dominant state narratives, the taken for granted androcentrism of the state apparatus continues to impact recognition of survivors of wartime sexual violence. I analyze the 2014 Amendment to the Law on Civilian Victims of War in light of the current application process for state-level benefits for survivors, and argue that the Amendment does well to support some survivors, while still maintaining state narratives of singular, ethnic priorities.

An adaptable, inclusive, and integrative perspective is offered as an alternative to the deficit-oriented approach which emphasizes the cultural and social deficits of migrant communities in France and Germany as the root problem of the education gap.",Degree: MA,PDF file (807k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Among its tools to reestablish its hegemony, particularly on the young generations of men who witnessed or participated in these political events, the military expanded the reach of conscription even beyond its standard qualifications. It aims to admit as many young men as possible in the mandatory military service to reconstruct them according to its image of militarized masculine citizenship. However, after conducting a series of qualitative interviews with former conscripts, I argue that contradictory experiences of the conscripts during their service render complex this vision of the military. These experiences were marked by the interviewees’ subjective daily negotiations with the difficulties of military life and the institution’s discourse, resulting in different feelings of apathy, depression, and uselessness for many soldiers. The experiences are also complicated by various embodiments the military’s masculine identities, as well as the military’s institutional inconsistencies and bureaucratic ills.",Degree: MA,PDF file (441k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

The study uses New Keynesian open-economy framework, featuring nominal rigidities in prices, fexible exchange regime and introduction of multiple sectors in the economy. The tariffs are added in the model to assess the e ects of tariff shocks in the economy. The model closely follows the methodology used in Linde and Pescatori (2017) and Erceg et al. (2017), but deviates from the symmetry assumption, and adds sectors in the economy to see the effects of trade war when applied only on one speci c sector. For the analysis, I use cross-country data on GDP, terms of trade, and tari s available at the World Trade Organization andWorld Bank. As a result, the unilateral increase in tariff rate on the sector of A&S decreases the US GDP, labor and nominal wages. China's retaliation worsens the effects on terms of trade and GDP. Trade war substantially o sets the real appreciation of the dollar.",Degree: MA,PDF file (841k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA

Franchise is widely recognized as a modern, yet new and complex model of doing business, making it an exceptionally interesting topic to analyze. The selection of jurisdictions is made with respect to the rich experience on franchise that comes from United States, the birthplace of business format franchise, that had been followed by Europe. Notably, business format franchise is treated differently in these two continents and that is why an analytical comparison sheds the light over the reasons for regulating, as well positive and negative features of various regulatory regimes. Serbia, on the other hand, is the central subject of this thesis. Franchise in Serbia is treated as an innominate contract, with no particular regulation and developed practice. However, the novelty in Serbia is the Draft of Civil Code that is not yet enacted, but regulates franchise for the first time. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to analyze the Draft and evaluate it by comparison with other regulatory systems.",Degree: MA,PDF file (755k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA
