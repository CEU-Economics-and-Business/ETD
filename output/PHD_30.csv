I assume that young agents’ instrumental behavior is supported by practical reasoning processes; I justify this assumption by a review of empirical data from developmental psychology. The full-fledged model corroborates the developmentalists’ claim regarding the inferential support for imitative learning. It strengthens the argument that infants’ learning of practical skills and artifact functions from observation of adult human agents is an instance of teleological instrumental rationality. However the roles of perceptual, motor, or memory capacities of the human mind are also considered. The model is built in the thesis in two steps: first I spell out the proposed conceptualization of the processes that support infants’ performance in the head-touch task, and then I provide a technical depiction of those processes in the logic of choice.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (1751k),ETD,,Agent (Philosophy),

The essence of retooling the regime is to better help facilitate the restructuring of such businesses, putting them in a position to return to profitability in such a way that best balances the rights and claims of its stakeholders. Critical to this process is the availability of new financing, first in the interim to keep the business going and then also to help it implement a workable restructuring plan. It cannot be gainsaid that the availability of new financing may determine the success or otherwise of the restructuring efforts. Lending by itself presupposes some risks. This riskiness is further exacerbated by the fact of financial distress. Intuitively, lending to distressed businesses will not be ordinarily typical for providers of financing. This has spurred the growing need to incentivize providers of financing to distressed businesses. On the flipside, it has also informed the need to check possible overreaching, occasioned by new financing whether by pre-distress lenders or by new lenders who for various reasons are now becoming the face of distress lending.  These issues are addressed in this dissertation on a comparative basis, analyzing the approaches in the US, UK and Germany and drawing lessons for frontier markets like Nigeria which is at the threshold of reworking its bankruptcy regime in the light of the growing acceptance of restructuring as an important part of the that regime. The Nigerian analysis is of relevance to similarly placed frontier markets.  The dissertation investigates and shows that jurisdictional approaches to statutory incentivizing of new financing differ along the lines of two articulated approaches: a prescriptive approach on the one hand, and a market-based approach on the other. Thus, while on the one hand, there is a prescriptive approach, which spells out defined explicit rules for providing new financing, protection for prior lenders, on the other hand, there is a market-based approach, which emphasizes the role of the market as the better judge of when a distressed lender may be incentivized, how the incentives may be designed, and what concession prior lenders may be willing to make. In the face of these two competing approaches to incentivizing new lending, the dissertation examines the underlying indices that support this divergence in the articulated approaches.  The dissertation further investigates the use of new financing agreements as instruments of lender capture, given their implications for other stakeholders of the business. In this regard, the dissertation critically examines the theoretical justifications for the key provisions of such agreements and, on a comparative basis, existing principles that can be used to countermand overreaching provisions of such agreements.  Finally, while pointing out the role of the distressed debt market as a source of distressed financing with growing importance, the dissertation argues that courts can play a key role in balancing the misalignments that can arise from the participation of distressed debt investors as financers in the restructuring process. In a related sense, the dissertation critically examines the manifestation of the distressed debt market in emerging markets like Nigeria and the opportunity presented through non-performing loans, arguing that the regulatory pattern of entry into the market may dis-incentivize distress debt investing in a market that is in dire need of financing.",PDF file (2894k),ETD,,Corporate reorganizations,

Paradigm changes are implemented in societies first and foremost through a redefinition of indicators. Our current indicator systems do not take into account the complexity of human social, economic and material systems and prioritize “efficiency” and “growth”. The objective of this research was to develop an indicator for one type of anthropogenic complex systems, i.e. cities that took into account the complex nature of the system and provided a quantitative way to prioritize alternative values such as “resilience” and “sustainability”. Scaling has been identified as one measure of complexity in a system, which is relatively easy to compute and comprehend. Here, I have developed a scaling indicator for cities based on fractal dimension. US block wise census data was used to calculate the exponent of the power-law distribution of population density across different census blocks in a city. The power-law, or scaling indicator, herein referred to as the fractal dimension was then compared to parameters such as population, area, population density, gasoline sales, gasoline sales per capita and area, and carbon emissions and carbon emissions per capita. It was noted that the fractal dimension had a power-law correlation with gasoline sales per unit area in the cities. The analysis was then extended a second complex system, i.e. national economies. Fractal dimension or scaling of percentages of incomes across the highest earning to lowest earning twenty percent segments of the population was calculated using World Bank economic data for 2004 (the year for which most extensive dataset was available). The relationship between this scaling indicator and energy usage per capita in countries was again found to be a power-law with an r-square value of more than 0.35 (similar to the correlation between urban fractal dimension and gasoline sales per area in cities). A new planning tool is developed to allow incorporation of consideration of these complexity indicators in development planning for cities and national economies. The planning-plane allows for visualization of the impacts of particular interventions in cities (e.g. housing scheme) and economies (e.g. changes in tax-code) on energy consumption parameters across two independent variables (e.g. population and fractal dimension) instead of the usual practice of using one indicator (e.g. population density). The similar nature of the correlation between scaling indicators and energy consumption indicators in two completely different anthropogenic complex systems hints at some underlying similarity in the mechanism through which these complex systems develop. It is hypothesized here that steeper scaling (e.g. higher income differences in economies) in complex systems makes good system regulation more energy intensive, thereby affecting the energy consumption parameters as observed in this study. Steeper scaling also thus negatively affects the effectiveness of regulation in complex systems and makes the system more prone to internal shocks. Planning system evolution for resilience would thus benefit from consideration of scaling indicators in the planning process.",ETD,Unrestricted,City planning -- Environmental aspects,

Frankfurt developed his hierarchical theory of desires. This controversial theory led to fruitful debates not only in connection with the problem of free will but in other areas as well including personal and practical identity, rationality in action and the problem of agency in general. Thus, this dissertation is not focused on the problem of free will but on the role of second-order desires in agency. More particularly, it discusses the importance of two features of human agency that Frankfurt emphasized most. First, humans are reflective, that is, they can evaluate their own desires. Second, humans are capable of caring about things, that is, some things are important for them in a special way. Frankfurt understands both of these crucial abilities as based on our ability to have second-order desires. In agreement with Frankfurt, I will argue that both reflectivity and caring are very important and basic abilities, and that they are connected to each other. However, I will disagree about their relation and about the definition of caring as dependent on second-order desires. I will argue that caring in the most basic sense is not a reflective ability but a first-order evaluation which is centrally important to action. I will also try to show that the reason humans have second-order desires is that they care about things. Thus, our second-order desires should be based on our personal values; in other words, what we care about. As a consequence, the most important claim of this dissertation is the following: though humans are reflective creatures, it is not reflectivity that is the most important feature of human life. Rather, caring, as a first-order evaluation is more important and our ability to reflect about our motivation depends on being able to care about things in this sense. At the end of the dissertation I will briefly discuss a serious problem for any caring based theory of action: the problem of self-control and self-management. Since we do not directly control by decisions what we care about, it seems that we cannot have these abilities. However, I will try to sketch a method of self-control and self-management which is consistent with the importance of the redefined concept of caring and which is based on self-trust and openness. This method will add one more argument against the importance of reflectivity: second-order desires do not help us in managing our desires; rather, they can interfere with self-control and become self-defeating strategies.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (694k),ETD,,Free will and determinism,

Established 20 years ago as a voluntary cooperation initiative on higher education cooperation in Europe, the BP has set important policy objectives for national higher education systems and Europe at large. While government representatives, through the ministerial meetings constantly agree on what they should implement in their national higher education systems, implementation reports show considerable differences between countries and higher education institutions (HEIs) with regard to implementation. Starting with the early stages of the BP scholarly work has demonstrated that there is an increasing interest in studying the different dimensions of BP implementation. A considerable amount of these studies has focused on assessing and explaining the different levels of BP implementation yet there is a gap in addressing the implementation of the BP from an integrated perspective. This dissertation aimed to fill this gap and asked What are the factors explaining the different levels of implementation of higher education policies within the Bologna Process? First of all, this dissertation seeks address the research gap by focusing on specific policy areas within the BP (quality assurance and the social dimension), diverse county contexts and higher education institutions within such contexts (Moldova, Portugal, and Romania). Secondly, it aims to contribute to the broader policy implementation literature by providing a conceptual understanding of policy implementation, by breaking it into adoption, transposition and practical implementation, and by putting forward an integrated set of factors for each of the three implementation stages, and empirically test them through semi-structured interviews. The dissertation hypothesizes three causal mechanisms for each of the implementation levels. Firstly, is hypothesized that adoption is the result of policy fit between commonly agreed policies at the BP level and national preferences and interests, as resulted through national representatives’ participation in BP. The causal model predicts that if BP policies have the support of top domestic actors and structures, this may push the national policies closer to the ones promoted by the BP. As a result, BP structures prefer to collaborate with those domestic actors who are in favor of its policies. Secondly, specific to the transposition stage it can be hypothesized that mutual learning and other socialization processes equip governmental agencies and bodies, societal actors, and the academic community with information about the main developments at the EHEA level and contribute to national level policy-making by feeding back national policy makers, affecting the choice for specific policy instruments and implementation mechanisms. Last but not least, at the HEIs level rectors and top-managers, academic and administrative staff, and students develop institutional plans and policies in line with the national level policies or the BP depending on their participation as stakeholders in the policy-making processes, autonomy and the added value of the policies in question. First of all, this dissertation highlighted the complex relationship between the BP, national, and institutional policy-making and the importance of national and institutional (interest) structures, actors (coalitions) and processes in connecting these levels. While it is assumed that that there is a “filter” when it comes to the implementation the BP commitments, with each level and layer of policy-making preconditioning the following (adopting the necessary legislation, transposition and institutional practices) this dissertation has shown that this is very much dependent on the policy in question. Quality assurance (QA) is a rather structural and technical area, with clear conceptualizations and operationalizations, with structures and bodies at the European, national and institutional level, whereas the social dimension (SD) is underdeveloped in this respect. HEIs implement QA policies because of the competitive environment they have to operate in but also because of the existent monitoring mechanisms (at the institutional, national and BP level). The SD is a rather sensitive area, with most of the universities putting forward their preferred approaches on how to deal with such issues. If in the case of QA in most of the country cases there is a national level agency which pushes for implementation at the HEIs level, in the case of SD the situation is loose.",ETD,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",

Having been a women’s organization in the Ukrainian diaspora and an ethnic organization in American and international women’s movements from its inception, the UNWLA often considered its participation in international women’s forums instrumental in promoting the cause of Ukraine’s sovereignty. Instead of withdrawing from this arena in the early years of Ukraine’s independence, however, the UNWLA started to adopt the women’s rights and equality discourses for generating relations with the state and non-state actors in Ukraine and for conceptualizing a vision for the organization’s future. Drawing on fieldwork findings from the New York City branches of the organization, I argue that the current shift in the UNWLA’s relation to women’s rights movement has been triggered not only by the changes in the political status of their homeland, but also by the generational shift in the UNWLA membership as well as by the growing currency of women’s rights discourses in the international politics.",Degree: PhD,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,

First, we discuss the operator theoretic counterparts of the central ergodic theoretical notions of strong and weak mixing. These concepts correspond to particular types of asymptotic behaviour of operator semigroups in the weak operator topology, called weak and almost weak stability. Using functional analytic tools and methods from ergodic the- ory, we describe various features of (almost) weakly stable semigroups. In particular, we show that (in the Baire category sense) typical elements in certain natural spaces of semi- groups are almost weakly but not weakly stable, thus we carry over classical theorems of Halmos and Rohlin for measure preserving transformations to the Hilbert space operator setting. Further, we illustrate operator semigroup methods and results on a class of telegraph systems with various boundary conditions. We study both linear and nonlinear boundary value problems. The stability of linear telegraph systems is discussed by applying theorems from the previous chapters. For the existence of solutions, we are particularly interested in time-dependent boundary conditions, since this case has little been investigated so far. The operator semigroup techniques applied to the case of Lipschitz continuous non- linearities are combined with estimates from the theory of monotone operators to yield well-posedness and the regularity of the solutions, also in the case of dynamic boundary conditions.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (550k),ETD,Unrestricted,Measure theory,

It focuses on the d65, which is a critical case for East-West labor transnationalism in view of the importance of cost comparisons among car plants in different countries. The analysis of Polish-German union relations at three car and car component manufacturing companies, Volkswagen’s engine plants, GM and MAN, shows that the German unions sought to establish cooperative links with their Polish counterparts in the areas subject to cross-border comparisons, when no national negotiation channels were available to them and thus the danger of underbidding by the cheaper Polish plants was particularly high. The Poles, in turn, cooperated in exchange for the Germans’ support, only if they expected to benefit more from the Western assistance than from local solutions. Alternatively, they did not hesitate to utilize their comparative advantage of lower wages and inferior working conditions to attract new production. The resulting cooperation was based on reciprocal exchange. The Germans helped the Poles build up their organizations and assisted them during disputes with the local management, whereas the Poles committed themselves not to underbid the Germans during investment distribution rounds. Overall, East-West European labor transnationalism was guided primarily by cost-benefit considerations. The evidence on GM unions’ reactions to the economic crisis of 2008-2009 corroborates this assertion, showing that German employee representatives used enhanced government access to secure the interests of their sites at the cost of other locations, which led to deep divisions in the once unified cross-border GM labor front.  The last chapter tests the above arguments against evidence from the construction sector, in which the inflow of CEE workers to West European labor markets constituted a major source of competitive pressure. It shows that the mechanism governing interactions between Polish and German construction unions resembled the one identified in the car industry. Specifically, the scope of cooperation remained narrower due to the German union’s attachment to national solutions and limited gains derived by the two Polish organizations from participating in migrant workers’ assistance schemes.","CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",

I propose an investigation which unfolds in two parts. In the first part, I examine the relationships that hold between personal autonomy, political authority and rationality, focusing on a reading of these relationships according to which, even though autonomous individuals may not a have reason to comply with the directives of political authority as long as they consider the matter from the standpoint of individual rationality, they may nevertheless have a reason to comply with such directives if they consider the matter from the standpoint of collective rationality. I explore the strengths and limitations of a model that tries to provide the normative foundations of political obligation by employing the principle of collective rationality, and conclude that, while the principle of collective rationality plainly dictates a greater level of compliance with the law than the principle of individual rationality taken in conjunction with an individual’s moral values would dictate, the same considerations which are invoked to establish the need to appeal to a principle that would give one a reason to obey the law over and above what substantive moral principles working within the framework of individual rationality give one reason to do might render implausible any attempt to account for political obligation by reference to such substantive moral principles. To deal with this difficulty, I introduce a particular conventionalist account, hoping to take a step in the direction of rehabilitating the idea that the reasons for obeying the law can be accounted for by appeal to substantive moral considerations.  In the second part, I scrutinize the main arguments used within the conventionalist framework that I focus on in order to back up the claim that political obligation, if it exists, can only be accounted for in terms of interdependent reasons for action. I look at the idea that a promising strategy in dealing with the problem of political obligation is to show that the treatment of ordinary coordination problems can be extended to other game theoretic situations, such as the prisoner’s dilemma. I find that the conventionalist account is able to answer the objection that any conventionalist account of authority and political obligation is misguided because the conventionalist analysis cannot properly be applied to situations of significant conflict of interests. I also argue that, in order to defend the conventionalist view according to which political obligation is to be justified by reference to a pattern of mutual expectations, one should make crucial use of the idea of cooperative dispositions. To this end, I show that conventionalists are right in claiming that assumptions about cooperative dispositions are not ad hoc, and, hence, that conventionalism can make sense of the idea that patterns of mutual expectations are not immune to moral criticism.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (1326k),ETD,Unrestricted,,Political obligation,

Notwithstanding the persistent interest in the study of state censorship, the aspect that certain levels of coordination have to occur under invariably vague regulations is surprisingly neglected. Yet, given the role played by censorship in sustaining non-democratic regimes, the Soviet-type for instance on which the present analysis is centered, how the system internally managed to deal with uncertainties concerning censorship norms, and how the main actors coped with it, is surely a pertinent question. The research was designed to address both formal and informal aspects of the censorship process. For assessing formal organizational solutions, I use mid-level theories developed in the vein of the structural contingency approach to organizational design, whereas for the study of informal practices, I draw on theoretical insights offered by the comparative political science literature and a conceptual typology of informal practices/institutions that I developed based on three typologies (Nee and Ingram 1998, Lauth 2000, Helmke and Levitsky 2006a). In terms of methods, I combine institutional analysis and historical ethnography, which involves processing data derived from official documents and subjective sources (interviews, memoirs, diaries and contemporary correspondence). The empirical analysis is based on a single case, that is, the Romanian censorship system in the state socialist period (1949–1989). Within the case, the focus on formal mechanisms is narrowed to the extreme end of the pre-publication procedure, the activity of local censors’ offices namely. With regards to informal mechanisms, the analysis is focalized on positive interpersonal relationships between the actors of the censorship system, particularly those nurtured among the controllers and controlled, and the allied informal practices. The intensive analysis of the Romanian case resulted that the effective implementation of the censorship policy was maintained by a complex set of formal organizational coordination and control mechanisms that were appropriately designed to meet critical contingencies (i.e. task uncertainty), as well as by various types of informal practices based on trust-centered interpersonal ties. The types of informal practices that furthered the formal scopes of censorship include the spread and clarification of information regarding censorship norms via peers and censors (complementary informal practices), censors sharing confidential directives (accommodating practices), as well as counseling and ensuring with controllers prior to official checking (substitutive practices). The fourth type comprises interactions that eventually undermined the effectiveness of the censorship policy, practices such as negotiations between the censors and editors-in-chief/authors, intervening through personalized networks on behalf of a publication, or taking a risk by turning a blind eye to problematic issues (competing of practices). These findings complement accounts of the functioning and effectiveness of the Soviet-type censorship system primarily focused on macro institutional and organizational configurations. Furthermore, the results shed light on practices constituting the domain of “self-censorship”, which is also claimed by the literature to represent an important factor contributing to the effectiveness of censorship. Finally, by focusing on positive interpersonal ties and related practices, the findings considerably alter the dominant narrative centered on negative relationships between the controllers and the controlled, yet they also show that many interactions based on positive ties had the same effects as their negative counterparts: raising the performance of the censorship system.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2650k),ETD,Unrestricted,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",

It explores agromanufacturing- from the colonial period to the present-day Kenya to show the evident underlying continuity of colonial structures and contradictions characteristic of different large-scale commercial agriculture as a strategy of national and regional development across the country. By focusing on everyday lives of the plantation labourers in the South Nyanza sugarbelt, the dissertation reveals the nature and dynamic of development generally and the large scale commercial farming economy in particular as unpredictable and chaotic. What is more significant from the findings is the demonstrated acceptance, integration and accommodation of chaos into the constitutive and operational logic of the plantation economy and its development itinerary. Throughout the dissertation, the relations between the agromanufacturing complex as a structure designed for modernization intervention and the invisible everyday lives of those in its orbit are shown to be characterized by unpredictability, contradictions, differentiations, violence, deprivations and exploitative dispossession. Combined, these make lives under such development interventions insecure, disjointed, vulnerable and disorderly. My study contributes to the sociology and social anthropology of development by proposing a fresh look at development interventions as ‘chaotic projects’ which produce disorder rather than smooth solutions to technical disorder. Such a look, building on works of other such as Tania Li and James Ferguson, integrates the ideas of Foucault to show how development has in effect become a series of normalizations where more attention is focused on making things seem normal rather actually transforming them. For instance, the study shows how dispossession of land, labour and employment safeguards are part of repertoire of tactics employed to enhance efficiency and productivity in the factory though they expose the plantation workers and villagers to extreme deprivation and invisibility. Furthermore, the study responds to the significant absence of a disciplinary society approach to development related research in Africa though much of the interventions are implemented as disciplinary projects. By combining Foucault’s conception of power and the concept of chaos in studying agromanufacturing as development in Kenya, the study shows how development is not only chaotic but sustained by chaos: under development, disorder is the order. This is the central argument in the dissertation.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2632k),ETD,Agriculture -- Economic aspects -- Kenya,

On the other hand, the enhanced self-consciousness or even pride of the Renaissance author compared to that of the earlier medieval one is a long established commonplace; indeed, humanist poets were inclined, in varying degrees, to self-fashioning, self-mythologizing. My interdisciplinary study focuses on the junction of these two basic habits of mind of German humanists around 1500. I reveal solar and astral (mainly astrological) symbolism in Neo-Latin poetical works and visual artworks of this period, and investigate how this cosmic symbolism was used for self-representative purposes. Among the German humanists I focus on Conrad Celtis (1459-1508), the “„arch-humanist” of Germany, the first poet laureate of his nation, the ""bringer of the muses"" to the German land. Celtis's personality, poetic talent, ambition, scientific-philosophical interests, his assumed role − all this resulted in various interesting ways of ""cosmic"" self-representation; I argue that this is a core area of his whole poetical oeuvre. In the investigated period of German humanism (c. 1485-1510), some other poets who were friends of Celtis also employed astronomical, astrological, cosmological imagery in the construction of their (or the group's) humanist identities, in various ways, to various extent: Jakob Locher, Laurentius Corvinus (Rabe), Johannes Tolhopf, Augustinus Moravus; I involve in my research representative works of these authors, too. The first chapter reviews the poetological background of the enhanced vates-ideology of the German humanists: the humanist revaluation of poetry in the Renaissance and the “„defense of poetry” tradition. The second chapter overviews Celtis’s ideas about astronomy-astrology, micro- and macrocosm in general. Chapters 3-6 explore Celtis’s and his firends’ strategies of “„cosmic” self-representation through analyses of specific works. Humanists could support their vates-role by means of their (idealized) birth horoscope or the horoscope of laureation (ch. 3-4); or they could develop a complex Phoebean symbolism based on Phoebus, the solar god who supports the poet in various ways (ch. 5). Humanist group-identity could be strengthened through a Phoebean-Bacchic symbolism and the mythologizing of humanist feasts (ch. 6).",Degree: PhD,PDF file (9848k),ETD,Unrestricted,,

Based on low wages and low taxes, the country’s political economy mitigates against the emergence of а ‘broad middle’ habitually associated with the developed welfare states of the West. 80% of the working population ekes out less than 500 EUR monthly, making Bulgaria the poorest EU-member state. After three decades of neoliberal reforms, the country’s class structure resembles that of a Third world country: a tiny opulent minority sits atop a vast ocean of poverty. The unpopularity of this mode of economic development prompted the liberal ideologues of the Transition to create a social base for the liberal reforms in the early 2000s, a project that culminated with the 2013 anti-corruption protests. Therefore, I analyze the insurgent “middle class” as a political, rather than economic formation. More specifically, I explore the formation of the Bulgarian middle class from the vantage point of the 2013 summer protests. That year saw feverish protest mobilizations in two phases in winter and summer. Even though these protests occupy determinate temporal frames, their significance reverberates to this day because commentators continue to make sense of current events through the prism of the “long 2013.”  Time and again pundits and participants stated that the summer protests portended the birth of the middle class. I follow these discussions in the public sphere and tease out the vectors of inclusion into the self-identified middle class.  The first part of the thesis focuses on class formation and class consciousness where class is understood in materialist yet non-economistic terms. I offer a way of thinking about the problem of the ‘middle class’ that breaks with the double objectivism of structural and mechanical theories extrapolating its existence from the laws of capital in Orthodox Marxism, on the one hand, and from liberal stratification theories which rely on arbitrary income brackets to discern its existence, on the other. Because of the strong emphasis on class polarization, inherited from the Manifesto, the ‘middle class’ has traditionally posed a challenge Marxists have tended to overcome via a recourse to Weberian ‘prosthetics’.  In contrast, I treat class as a political becoming, every class is always-already a “class against”. Thus, a ‘subjectivist’ approach to social class is well suited to understand this formation. To this end, I fashion a theoretical apparatus out of Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology and the Essex School’s Discourse Theory to account for the discursive and polemical constitution of the middle class of the 2013 summer protests. This theoretical amalgam offers a polemical slant to theorizing class formation, resonating with some early remarks on the political nature of social class by Karl Marx.  I do so against the backdrop of the thorny path of the neoliberal reform in Bulgaria. I argue that the middle class is the crystallization of a long search on part of policy elites, civil society practitioners and democratization experts to find the “social base” for the neoliberal reform, perceived as increasingly beleaguered by populism, left and right.  One such challenge to the reform consensus came in the wake of the winter protest of 2013. It rebelled against austerity, poverty and the political establishment, yet it did so by poaching the liberal semantic field and appropriating the language of “civil society”. The summer protests re-appropriated the appropriation and, in the process, subjectivized itself as “middle class” against the winter protests and the corrupt oligarchic elite.  The second part of the thesis traces the effects the 2013 class imaginaries exert on the formal and universalistic political equality under liberalism. The discourse of “the middle class” organized the protesters’ normative visions about citizenship and national identity along increasingly inegalitarian, demophobic and elitist lines.  This dissertation thus follows an instance of ‘class struggle’ unfolding on the terrains of civil society, citizenship and nationhood. I show how the radicalization of imaginaries about class difference are projected onto the political field resulting in a tendency to question formal equality under liberalism.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (4468k),ETD,Middle class -- Bulgaria,

In the last four decades many linguist, philosopher and cognitive scientist, working on an account of how we communicate by means of metaphors, started with pointing out what Davidson got wrong or right. His view that metaphor carries no special meaning or content different form the literal meaning of the expressions it is comprised of, that it is simply a tool to draw our attention to similarities, served as the starting point for many to articulate their own theory (cf. Bergmann, 1982; Rorty and Hesse, 1987; Moran, 1989; Hills, 1997; Stern, 2000; Camp, 2003; Guttenplan, 2005; Reimer and Camp, 2006; Camp, 2008; Stern, 2008; Reimer, 2008; Lepore and Stone, 2010). is thesis is no different. I think what Davidson essentially got right is emphasizing the causal effects of metaphors, i.e., that metaphors nudge us into noting similarities, to take on a new perspective on the mentioned things. He also thought—to anticipate, this will be where I disagree—that this is the ulterior aim of metaphor and the metaphorical speaker. Consequently, according to Davidson, there is no special meaning the speaker aims to convey, given that this effect can be achieved by the literal meaning of the uttered sentence, or its comprehension thereof. is is not to deny that the metaphor has a point iv or that it inspires a lot of thoughts. In his Communication and Convention, Davidson (1984, 273) links what he calls ulterior purposes of utterances to John L. Austin’s notion of perlocution (Austin, 1962); acts people perform by uttering sentences. Such an act for instance is, making the audience to undertake certain actions by asking them to do so, or to surprise them by what one is saying. Given this much, Davidson (1978) can be described as developing a perlocutionary theory of metaphor (cf. Lepore and Stone, 2010). My aim is to show that a perlocutionary theory does not have to follow Davidson’s arguments and conclusions, just roughly outlined above. After a careful examiniation of the notion of metaphorical meaning, the perspectival effect of metaphors, and the notion of perlocution and perlocutionary effects, I will argue, first, that metaphors’s effect of making us see something in a new light is indeed a perlocutionary effect. I call this the Perlocution Claim. Second, I will also point out that achieving perlocutionary effects are not necessarily the ulterior purposes of the speakers. In most cases, they are just one among the many intended effects a speaker can have in uttering something. Consequently, Davidson’s claims about the casual effects of metaphors will not support his conclusion that there is no metaphorical meaning beyond the perspectival effect of metaphors, in as much as there are examples where eliciting the metaphorical effect is not the final aim of the speaker. Examples are not hard to find, and they support the existence of metaphorical meaning contrary to Davidson. Nevertheless, recent theories of metaphorical meaning do not fit well with the Perlocution Claim. Partly, because they reject the claim as belonging to Davidsonian non-cognitivsm (cf. Stern, 2000), a label introduced to designate theories denying the existence of metaphorical meaning. Additionally, because they also consider perlocutionary effects to be final, non-linguistic, aims of utterances. e proposed theory of metaphor endorsing the Perlocution Claim relies on the v distinction between different possible realizations of perlocutionary effects. It incorporates a non-cognitivist theory for some examples of metaphors while at the same time, using the same theoretical framework, it provides an account of how metaphorical utterances have a special meaning on certain occasions. As a theory of metaphorical meaning, it is close to that developed by Elisabeth Camp (2003; 2008; 2014) on which if there is a metaphorical meaning, it is an inexplicit meaning which the hearer has to recover by way of cultivating the perspective offered in the metaphor.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (641k),ETD,,Language and languages -- Philosophy,

Previous comparative research emphasized the role of institutions in conditioning individuals’ behavior and attitudes. I argue that not only the institutional design, but also the quality of the political institutions in the country constrains citizens’ political attitudes, preferences, and decisions. I do this by examining how living in countries with different quality of governance affects people’s institutional trust,perceptions of representation and accountability, attitudes towards the welfare state, voting behavior, and election results both in an absolute sense and relative to the design of the political institutions. Doing so this dissertation builds on and contributes to the literature of comparative political behavior, contextual effects, and political institutions, and has substantive and normative implications for the study of electoral democracy. All of the empirical analyses are cross-national and employ multilevel analyses of data from Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the World Value Survey, and different indicators of the quality of governance and political institutions.  After a brief introduction, I examine the implications of various aspects of good governance on individuals’ confidence in different public and political institutions. I find that some aspects of good governance have a stronger impact on institutional trust than others, but how the institutions provide judicial and bureaucratic efficiency and control of corruption clearly makes them look more or less trustworthy. I then look at the role of the quality of governance in shaping individual preferences toward income redistribution and social welfare policies, and find that bad governance leads to a remarkable inconsistency in individuals’ preferences, preferring more extensive social benefits simultaneously with less income redistribution. I investigate further whether people feel less represented and politicians’ less accountable under bad governance in chapter four. I find that institutional design matters more for a sense of procedural representation, while good governance is more important for substantive representation. Chapter five focuses on the link between the impact of ideology, economic evaluations and partisanship on the vote on the one hand, and corruption on the other, and the implications of cultural norms for these relationships. I find that as corruption rises, ideological considerations and sympathies towards the chief executive party weigh less in voters’ decision; and while living in a country with a strong culture of corruption does not make people adopt different voting behavior, it instills a higher likelihood of voting against the incumbent. Before concluding, I test the electoral implications of good governance for incumbent’s survival in chapter six, and find that the quality of governance is as important as the economy.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2002k),ETD,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",

The creation of the anthology was personally initiated by emperor Alexios Komnenos (1081-1118) and was related with the religious politics of the Byzantine Empire. In the history of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, this anthology remained as an important contribution in the systematization of the legacy of the Church Fathers and the cannon of texts which were used in the theological debates. The text gained considerable popularity with more than Greek 150 manuscripts and translations into Old Slavonic and Latin. The Panoplia consists of 28 chapters. Each of the initial seven chapters is dedicated to an important orthodox belief, while each of the following chapters refutes a major heresy in the history of the Church from the early Christian times until the twelfth century. The text is well known to the scholars dealing with Byzantium but has remained largely unexplored because of its length and monumental tradition. This thesis represents two episodes (loosely connected) in the transmission history of the anthology. The first section situates the Panoplia in the context of early modern Europe with the publication history of the first printed edition in Greek which happened in Wallachia in 1710. The dissertation proves that this edition was initiated by the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem in relation to the proselytizing activities of the Catholics and the Protestants. The inner conflicts among the Orthodox Christians necessitated the edition and the publication was connected with the coeval Eucharistic debates, which had their origins in Western Europe but were interiorized on Orthodox soil. The second part treats one single manuscript – MS Iviron grec 281 -- which shows significant differences from the Wallachia edition and the other Panoplia manuscripts which I was able to consult. Compared to the edition, the Iviron MS omits many of the Patristic texts, but adds scholia to the fragments of Pseudo-Dionysios the Areopagite and the orations of Gregory the Theologian (Orationes 28, 29, 30, 31, 38). The present study gives a sample of these scholia: it treats the fragments of Gregory of Nazianzos’ De Theologia, Oratio 30 and In Theophania, Oratio 38 as well as the five short scholia to the Pseudo-Dionysian fragments. The sources on the scholia to the text of the Areopagite lead to Ambigua ad Thomam of Maximus the Confessor. For the rest of the scholia, I was able to identify most of them as fragments authored by Nicetas Heracleensis and Elias Cretensis, two among the most prominent commentators of the Theologian.

The research reconstructs debates and dialogues between progressive clergy and radical religious intelligentsia following the massacre of Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905. The dissertation interprets the visions that emerged in the network of the Orthodox left in the framework of ‘political theologies’. It focuses on three programs and their theo-political language: the Brotherhood of Zealots for Church Renovation; the Christian Brotherhood of Struggle; and the Union of Christian Politics. Members argued that the mutually dependent relationship between the tsar and the people, which served as a political bedrock for the Empire for centuries, was now beyond repair. The bloodshed was perceived as a fundamental break in Russian Orthodox political theory, and the horrible events inspired religious intelligentsia and progressive clergy to theorise about politics and social justice as Orthodox believers. The dissertation identifies the concept of Christian obshchestvennost’ (sociality) as the focal point of all programs that emerged among advocates of the Orthodox left in the period. The concept had palingenetic power, it was meant to reinvigorate the Church and to re-Christianise the whole of fin de siècle Russian society. My research argues that the theo-political imagination and language of the Orthodox left was inspired both by Russian Orthodox tradition, in particular by Modern Russian Theology; and by non-Orthodox traditions of social Christianity, but it developed in opposition to the Marxist left.

This inquiry involves an interdisciplinary approach, combining history, theology, philosophy, and philology. At the beginning of the fourth century, after Christianity changed its status from persecuted to official recognition in the Roman Empire, an “ascetic revolution” spread especially among the members of the high aristocracy and of the middle-class. Sometimes several members of the same family, men and women, embraced the ascetic enthusiasm, experimenting with different ascetic modi vivendi in proximity to each other or in cohabitation. While authoritative Church Fathers legitimized some of the newly emerging communities, at the same time, they rejected other forms of double-gender asceticism, which they labelled as chaotic and “unruly.” Family double monasteries are rooted in the pious Late Antique households, generally belonging to the high aristocracy, with one notable exception – precisely the very one that had set the tone for this practice. Relatives, men and women, shared their inclination towards asceticism in proximity to each other either on their own family estates, or in new places. They formed quarters of monks and nuns who belonged to the same monastic unit, sometimes having a unique guidance (often a woman), they were economically and liturgically interdependent, but they lived separately and their encounters were thoroughly regulated. Thus, the flourishing communities which sprang from a family milieu and received the recognition of the Church Fathers are, in chronological order, the monastery of Tabennesi (Upper Egypt), founded by Pachomius and his sister, Mary (ca. 333-336); the monastery in Annisa (Cappadocia), which developed on the family estate of Macrina the Younger, her mother, and her brothers (ca. 345-356); the community founded in Bethlehem by Jerome, his brother, Paulinianus, and his spiritual daughter, Paula, together with the latter’s daughter, Eustochium (386); the monastery of Nola, founded by Paulinus and his wife, Therasia (395-396), which became a magnet for other ‘monastic spouses’ and formed a monastic network; the monastery which emerged at Primuliacum due to Sulpicius Severus, his wife, and his mother-in-law, Bassula (396-403); and the monastery founded on the Mount of Olives by Melania the Younger, her husband, Pinianus, and her mother, Albina (431-436). At the same time, other spouses renounced their matrimonial relations and continued to live as spiritual siblings in their own pious households, which they slowly transformed into ascetic dwellings, or, rarely, fled elsewhere. Not all the monastic spouses founded new communities, but some of them either joined already existent monasteries, or, after years of living in proximity, they separated. This thesis analyzed them as part of the double gender family asceticism which was recognized and legitimized. In the secondary literature scholars have been using the terminus technicus “double monastery” almost indiscriminately, for all eras and for all the regions, with the meaning of a coenobitic establishment that hosted ascetic men and women in seclusion. Generally, the term was opposed to other types of double gender communities called “mixed monasteries,” “neighbor monasteries,” or “distant monasteries.” Literature published from the nineteenth century until today distinguished two main stages of research, one lasting until the beginning of the twentieth century, and another one which started at the end of the 1980s. In this period, two disciplines, history and Church law, have been dealing with the problem of double monasteries. The syntagm “double monastery” cannot be easily applied to the fourth-century context, since the terms “duplex monasterium” and “διπλοῦν μοναστήριον” are first attested in 546, in Justinian’s Novel 123, while sources never use the other terms proposed in scholarship. However, since in English no other syntagm is able to cover accurately the particularities of the fourth- and fifth-century communities that my dissertation scrutinizes, throughout my work I conventionally referred to them by adopting the formula “family double monasteries.” Several common conditions led to the gradual development of this model of monasticism. First, a charismatic ascetic man attached to his male monastery a community of pious women who followed him and he set up a set of rules which concerned both groups of ascetics and their interaction. In other instances, men and women relatives transformed their “pious households” into ascetic establishments. In this case, they did not cease to live in the same environment, but at a later stage in their evolution, groups of monks and nuns were secluded, and a set of rules established the legitimate contacts between them. Yet, in other situations, relatives founded a community for both monks and nuns in a different place than their household. Such a place attracted other ascetically oriented family members, creating ‘monastic networks.’ Finally, in some situations, spouses decided to renounce their family connections and to become ascetics. Sources describe several stages in the accomplishment of such a decision, which had noticeable consequences at the social level. The sources pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the communities which my thesis investigates are mostly written. The hagiographies, letters, monastic rules, dialogues, homilies, sermons, and poems have their specific set of rules which concern their production, audience, and way of dissemination. Most of the sources belong to more than one category, a fact which is not surprising for the fourth-century context. Moreover, all the texts have male authors, a detail which becomes essential when analyzing references to ascetic women.....",Degree: PhD,PDF file (1861k),ETD,CEU Doctoral School of History,

Next, the research is focusing on the impacts of water privatization on households (water access and consumption profile, service quality, coping strategies, etc.). The research also seeks to examine the structural and process changes in the water sector as an aggregate mechanism of policies, legal and regulatory procedures, organizational structures, financing and impact mitigation mechanisms. The research is based on the mixed method approach with the application of several methodological tools. The major methodological components include ex-post benchmarking method, conversational/stakeholder interviewing, document analysis, and the household survey  bottom-up participatory approach that puts people at the core of the research. Research results show that intensive marketization trends with related structural changes reinforced privatization in public services. Conditional technical and financial support from donor institutions and urgency dictated by the deteriorating infrastructure made privatization a “no other option”. Even under the “forced” conditions, transition to the public-private provision of water services in Armenia had a positive influence on the sustainability performance of all water utilities. Armenian utilities also succeed in performing well internationally. However, the scale of impact of privatization depends on the initial state of the enterprise and the local context. Supportive legislation and regulation is needed for ensuring the attractiveness and incentives for the private sector participation and operation and for protecting consumers from monopoly abuse. Furthermore, although water supply services have been improved and people are generally satisfied with water services, there are still a number of service deficiencies that households face and try to cope with by implementing a number of measures that require additional costs and/or behavioural changes. Finally, after the high return and low risk low hanging fruits are reached during the first generation reforms to meet the most urgent needs, more efforts are required for enhancing long-term sustainability and effectiveness.",Water supply -- Armenia,

The regimes with concentrated power are believed to be particularly dangerous for the states with deep ethnic cleavages. This latter concern is a question of great importance for the post-Soviet region, because since the collapse of the Soviet Union some of the multi-ethnic post-Soviet states had the experience of both ethnic conflicts and concentration of power. Consequently, the main goal of this research is to determine whether power concentration encourages the escalation of ethnic conflicts. For this, I explore three mechanisms that may link the degree of power concentration with ethnic minorities’ mobilization against the state: identity-related state policies, electoral rules, and centralization. The empirical investigation is built on the analysis of three post-Soviet cases – Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine – based on the structured focused comparison technique. The data presented in this research reveal that the highest level of ethnic minorities’ mobilization against the state in the three post-Soviet republics occurred in periods with dispersed power, and not in periods with concentrated power. The research further shows that contrary to the common expectation, the reason for this was not the presumed suppressive character of concentrationist regimes over ethnic groups as citizens. Instead, the incumbent elites in the periods with power concentration combined minorities’ cooptation in central and local power with the enhanced control over the regional elite formation and regional access to financial resources, and in some cases, with a gradual de-politization of societal multi-ethnicity. Specifically, the leadership of concentrationist regimes tended to increase the threshold for accessing power through electoral rules with disproportional elements, which prevented the consolidation of ethnic parties and at the same time attracted minority leaders to the ruling parties. In addition, concentration of power tended to augment territorial centralization. This implied an increased control by central level political incumbents over the financial, administrative, and political affairs at regional level, which reduced local potential mobilizers’ access to mobilization resources. Finally, as the leadership of power concentration tended to implement integrationist rather than accommodationist policies towards minorities, this de-emphasized the political importance of multi-ethnicity.  The research concludes that at least in the three cases included in the analysis, concentration of power did not trigger, but it rather discouraged ethnic mobilization against the state, due to its intrinsic tendencies to increase the threshold for access to power of potential challengers and also to co-opt minority leaders, to strengthen centralization of power, and to de-politicize ethnicity. Hence, the success of concentrationist regimes in reducing minorities’ mobilization against the state did not consist in suppressing ethnic groups as citizens, but in hindering the formation of a self-standing ethnic minority elite. Therefore, if power concentration is to be avoided in the post-Soviet region, it should be for other reasons than for fear of ethnic instability.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (5258k),"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",

It examines the dynamics of EU interventions in conflicts, asking: Why and under what conditions does the EU decide to get involved in conflict resolution? In a conflict-prone world and competing security priorities, what determines EU involvement in particular conflicts? Do supranational institutions, such as the European Commission and the EU Council Secretariat, matter in initiating, shaping and implementing EU policies on conflict resolution? To answer these questions, I use institutionalist and intergovernmentalist theories to assess their relative explanatory power in accounting for the patterns of EU interventions in conflict. I find that these approaches are broadly complementary: institutionalism explains EU interventions in the low-politics areas of conflict resolution, while intergovernmentalism explains EU behaviour in the high-politics areas of intervention. When it comes to intervention in conflicts, EU foreign policy is like a light airplane: it can fly without being caught on radar as long as it flies ‘low’. By flying low (and slow), such an airplane can advance quite far into ‘enemy’ territory. However, if it increases its altitude above a certain threshold, it risks being detected by radars, and actions may be taken to halt the aircraft. The same holds true for EU interventions in conflicts. To avoid challenging EU member states, EU institutions often employ stealth intervention, operating predominantly in uncontroversial and depoliticised aspects of conflict resolution. By “flying low,” they are thus able to gradually extend their mandate from low-politics areas of conflict resolution to the high politics realm of overt intervention. Using a strategy I call “dosage”, EU institutions engage in a series of low-cost actions, which, over a longer period of time, can yield significant cumulated policy impact. However, if their involvement becomes suddenly controversial, as when EU institutions enter suddenly into the realm of high-politics, EU member states may move to limit their autonomy.  The dissertation traces the politics of stealth intervention by EU institutions using unpublished empirical data related to the EU decision-making process as well as interactions between the EU institutions, EU member states, and Russia in the conflict zones in question.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (306k),ETD,European Union -- Former Soviet republics,

It aims to explain how we got to the point, in which this way of doing business, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurship” in Berlin, became capable of being discussed and regarded as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. What is at stake is the discontinuity - acceptance of “ethnic entrepreneurship” - rather than trying to fit this singular event into a “natural flow of history”. This does not mean that it sets up chance over plans or principles in the interpretation of history. Rather, it intends to demonstrate that it was not self-evident that “ethnic entrepreneurship” as such had been accepted, defined and still has been discussed as a fundamental part of entrepreneurship. Hence, I look at the conditions of possibility by seeking out once again the links, which at a particular moment shape the self-evident. Deriving from these goals, the dissertation falls into two parts. In the first part (genealogical), I concentrate on the historical features of “ethnic entrepreneurship” and examine conditions of possibility in Berlin under the context of Germany and its regional and global relatedness through the rationalities and imaginations of policy makers, experts and intellectuals. In the second part (anthropological), I explore first, the ways individuals perform themselves as “ethnic entrepreneurs”; second, rules for this way doing things; and third, truth claims (as sphere where true and false can be carried out) for providing reasons about this way of doing things.  Within this structure, the contribution of this dissertation can be drawn from its objective: to challenge the binary opposition that emerges through the ways of thinking about “ethnic entrepreneurship”. This binary opposition is between the pre-given or essentialist understanding of culture and the “welcoming” understanding of diverse cultural co-existence. The former, associating a space with a pre-given identity and considering its existence as natural, underlines particular ways of doing businesses by “ethnic entrepreneurs”. The latter, acknowledging socially embeddedness of these economic agents in laws, institutions and social networks, “welcomes” their richness, potential and competence in doing business with the concepts like “transcultural”, “multicultural” and “cosmopolitan”. As a result of this relation, one enters a domain, where conflicting true and false discourses can be produced and re-produced in a continuous manner through exclusive (the former) and inclusive (the latter) formulations of culture. It is this binary opposition that I aim to challenge, since both of these approaches function as mechanisms of othering. By pursuing this goal, the dissertation illustrates how human beings have been turned into subjects, i.e. “ethnic entrepreneurs”.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2556k),ETD,Unrestricted,Turks -- Germany,

For Aristotle phantasia is a motion of the perceptive soul that makes possible a great amount of activities and higher cognitions beyond sense-perception. Phantasia became a fundamental psychological concept in the Hellenistic Era: in empiricist epistemology, in action theory as perceptual representation of the external world; in aesthetics as creative imagination. I argue that Alexander proceeds from an Aristotelian framework of parts and capacities of the soul, but unlike Aristotle, he distinguishes a distinct capacity for phantasia. The main reason for this comes from his polemic against the Stoics: they do not acknowledge an activity of phantasia. A distinct activity requires a distinct object, which in turn a distinct capacity. The distinct status of a phantasia-capacity in itself modifies the architecture of the soul in comparison with Aristotle. But in addition Alexander makes important changes in the framework: he makes capacities as basic (and rather modular), and parts and the soul as sets of capacities. The object of phantasia is the residue from perception in activity. The status of this as internal object needs clarification. I show that it is internal on account of being a physical process in the body. Again, I argue that it is the causal object of phantasia: it is the item that provides content to the phantasia-activity by triggering it. But the residue is not an intentional object: it is a representation of something else. I give a reconstruction of Alexander`s account how the residue may be representation. Accordingly, it is a representation in virtue of preserving fully a perceptual content (something that had been perceived); or in virtue of functioning as an equivalent of a fully preserved residue insofar as phantasia completed an incompletely preserved residue. The latter case explains a wide range of cases, in general the fact that phantasia is more prone to error than perception. Finally I analyse the activity of phantasia. I argue that its content is propositional, in particular it is ‘S is P’: a predication of a perceptible feature P of a thing that caused a perception S. First, I show that it is implausible to construe simple cases of phantasia (or perception: for perception has the same type of content as phantasia) as non-propositional, demonstrating that the object reading of the content (x sees ‘white’) is inadequate in that at the best it reduces to existential propositions (‘there is white’). Again, I analyse two positive evidences. (1) Alexander`s account of the truth-conditions of phantasia implies propositional content: phantasia is about an existent thing, S; and it is such as the thing, P. (2) The account of simultaneous perception (of several perceptibles) entails propositional content, and even uses examples as ‘this is white’. The phantasia-activity is said to be krisis, which I take to be judgement: primarily because its content is propositional. I argue that it is a certain type of judgement, perceptual, in contrast to conceptual judgements of the rational soul-part: esp. opinion. However, phantasia-judgement may be distinguished from perceptual judgement only because they are concerned with different objects: internal vs. external.",Degree: PhD,,Aristotle,
