What were the migration-related issues encountered by the women in dealing with the Philippine and Hungarian governments? What are the challenges of living and working in Hungary, and how do Filipina migrant workers address them? How does identity figure in these challenges and the womenâs responses to them? In making the above inquiries, the thesis not only broadens the discussion on Filipinas employed abroad in terms of occupation and geographical location, but also challenges essentialist narratives in existing literature on women OFWs. The research was enriched by drawing on the accounts of ten women OFWs in Hungary of different ages, civil status, occupations, and socio-economic backgrounds, with a view to find out as much as possible about their motivations and aspirations. This is important because studies or articles on women OFWs need to account for diverse jobs, personalities, individual circumstances leading to migration, and lived experiences that go beyond abuse, exploitation, or violence to have a fuller view of the womenâs complexities.  In order to analyze the information gathered from the women interviewees, a Feminist Global Political Economy (GPE) framework was used. This framework utilizes the feminist perspective to examine the situation of the women OFWs within the global political economy, which involves different actors and elaborate domestic-international, private-public, local-global, and south-north interactions. Concepts from intersectional and post-colonial theories were also incorporated to account for intersecting gender, race, and class identities of Filipinas as women of color, Asians, and âThird World women.â  The thesis will show that âFilipinasâ and âoverseas Filipina workersâ are not homogeneous categories and they have various reasons for leaving the Philippines and residing in Hungary, as well as various ways of responding to challenges posed by transnational labor migration. The women OFWs contend with restrictive state power in the form of regulated entry, residence, and exit, along with the discourse of the Philippine government that constructs them as objects that are naturally meant to be marketed as overseas labor. Filipinas in Hungary deal with gendered and racialized notions of who they are as women, workers, and partners. They also encounter racism and issues with migration and employment. However, In the milieu of neoliberal globalization where state and transnational business interests prevail, the women have had to rely on themselves and their informal networks for survival and development given the lack of support or services offered by the Philippine and Hungarian governments.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,ang_jona-marie.pdf

Today, nearly 2 billion people are active users of online markets. E-commerce, in its unique way, is the only borderless market and this feature makes its regulation highly complicated as of today, states are not able to agree on uniform set of rules that will govern the immense online market. The international nature of E-commerce constantly raises legal questions as the law struggles to catch up to a changing world. The non-geographical nature of E-commerce makes the traditional application of choice of law and jurisdiction rules difficult to apply, as these were designed for a pre internet age, based on connection factors, the strongest being geographical in nature. In E-commerce, it is highly complicated for the parties to identify the real location of the other as the transaction is based on informal declarations that are not all the time accurate, and even these geographical indicators can fail while talking about the contracts performed online. In order to ensure predictability and certainty in E-commerce transaction instead of using connecting geographical indicators it would be more useful to identify proper law and jurisdiction based on party autonomy. However even in this hypothesis it is highly probable that improper law and jurisdiction will be applicable. Such risk emerges because of unequal bargain power of the parties, E-businesses are usually assisted by professional lawyers that are able to design the terms of an E-contract in the favor of their clients. At the same time consumers are less likely to be aware about the meaning and consequences of such clauses as choice of law and choice of jurisdiction, furthermore they are not even able to negotiate the terms before agreeing to them. Hence validity and enforceability of these clauses are of a primary importance, especially because of the fast growing online market. This thesis will outline the main features of E-commerce contracts with specific references on choice of law and jurisdiction clauses. Also thesis will provide an overview of choice of law and jurisdiction laws in the EU, US, and Chinese legal system.",Degree: MA,PDF file (997k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,balaban_tatiana.pdf

The goal of this thesis is to highlight and analyze how the Russian intervention in Syria is being framed through speech acts, UN statements and interviews by Russian leaders such as President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and UN Permanent Representatives Vassily Nebenzia and Vitaly Churkin internationally as well as at home to the Russian public. In this academic work, I claim that Russia uses the pro-sovereignty argument to justify its intervention in Syria. I conclude that President Putin and other Russian spokespersons are using the pro-sovereignty discourse of intervention rather than the âResponsibility to Protectâ reasoning for justifying their involvement in Syria. This paper opens up further scope for future research on the significant role that framing can play in analyzing foreign interventions. Finally, this work also emphasizes that the same pro-sovereignty argument has been used by Russia before during other instances of interventions, and thus can be used for suggesting a broader pattern of behavior from the Russian end.",Degree: MA,PDF file (544k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,balial_nikkon.pdf

In order to understand these controversial outcomes, this thesis conducts a drug control policy impact assessment. It identifies and examines unintended drug policy impacts on the Rifâs economic, environmental, and social development. This thesis perceives and measures drug policy from a broader social context as the key drivers of drug markets stem from the demand-side of the drug trade, an approach global drug policy metrics fail to consider as they are focused on law and order. Therefore, in order for drug policy to effectively confront the world drug problem, it should recognize that the production of drugs occurs primarily within the fragile realities of rural, patriarchal, and impoverished regions.",Degree: MA,PDF file (772k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,bouhout_nouhaila.pdf

This thesis seeks to scrutinize the main reasons behind the failure of the Critical Security Studies (CSS) scholarsâ attempts to approach the altering nature of warfare and the role of human from a Human Security perspective. Therefore, it argues that in order to address the paradigm shifts in contemporary warfare and how it affects the role of humans on the battlefield successfully, Human Security should be re-connected with war-making. Instead of putting too much emphasis on drone warfare as the existing literature suggests, the more recent developments with the risk of eliminating humans from war-making should be addressed. Achieving a clearer understanding of what sort of motives that artificially intelligent units have would make it possible to control these motives.

Furthermore, this thesis reveals the effect of neighborhood on habitual dispositions of Tuzcu residents such as language incompetency, taste and gestures which are visible stigma signs of Tuzcu Roma. These aspects crystallize in the accessibility of forms of capital and induces economic poverty and stigmatization that reproduce their position in social space. Within this frame, I firstly explore tactics of Tuzcu Roma concerning poverty, stigmatization and the neighborhood effect. several tactics navigating the infrastructure of the neighborhood and the Turkish welfare system with the purpose of income generation. Other agentic processes include creating social and spatial distance . Regarding stigmatization as the outcome of Tuzcu Roma habitus, I scrutinize impression management of Roma by drawing on Goffmanian passing and covering strategies. Passing through covering emerges as the main strategy both among socially mobile and immobile Tuzcu Roma. When they draw on only iterational elements of stigmatized habitual dispositions, strategies are not successful. On the other hand, effective passing strategies through covering stem from cleft habitus of Tuzcu Roma which make use of projective and practical-evaluative element of the agentic dimension.

These events began in reaction to a homonormative and exclusionary permanent gay nightlife scene. I begin by providing background about Madison, its queer subculture, and the racial and class dynamics within the city. In the first chapter, I address the complications of defining queerness and community in both academic and organizing work, engaging in theoretical understandings of both terms, as well as incorporating the definitions and understandings of research participants. I use discourse analysis to parse the descriptions of several queer pop-up events in Madison and the political engagements of both permanent gay bars and Queer Pressure, a significant queer pop-up event series. In the second chapter, I begin with an analysis of the notion of the sacred within th scene, then move to engage with Jack Halberstamâs concepts of queer temporality and spatiality to consider the implications and possibilites of pop-up and queer takeover style events, in part by reflecting on sets, the spaces the parties take place in, and the transient nature of event series and Madison queers. In the third chapter, I take up the question of queer politics and intersectionality by reading Micheal Warnerâs definition of queer politics alongside Lisa Dugganâs conception of the homonormative, and reflect on the resonances of intersectionality and crip theory within these frameworks. I then discuss the homonormative politics of the Madison LGBTQ+ community, and contrast them with an analysis of Queer Pressureâs political commitments. The final section of this chapter is a case study of the No Cops at Pride movement, reactions to and consequences of its engagement with radical queer politics, and a brief analysis of the resonance of this movement in 2018 with the racial justice mass movement of 2020.

I propose an investigation which unfolds in two parts. In the first part, I examine the relationships that hold between personal autonomy, political authority and rationality, focusing on a reading of these relationships according to which, even though autonomous individuals may not a have reason to comply with the directives of political authority as long as they consider the matter from the standpoint of individual rationality, they may nevertheless have a reason to comply with such directives if they consider the matter from the standpoint of collective rationality. I explore the strengths and limitations of a model that tries to provide the normative foundations of political obligation by employing the principle of collective rationality, and conclude that, while the principle of collective rationality plainly dictates a greater level of compliance with the law than the principle of individual rationality taken in conjunction with an individualâs moral values would dictate, the same considerations which are invoked to establish the need to appeal to a principle that would give one a reason to obey the law over and above what substantive moral principles working within the framework of individual rationality give one reason to do might render implausible any attempt to account for political obligation by reference to such substantive moral principles. To deal with this difficulty, I introduce a particular conventionalist account, hoping to take a step in the direction of rehabilitating the idea that the reasons for obeying the law can be accounted for by appeal to substantive moral considerations.  In the second part, I scrutinize the main arguments used within the conventionalist framework that I focus on in order to back up the claim that political obligation, if it exists, can only be accounted for in terms of interdependent reasons for action. I look at the idea that a promising strategy in dealing with the problem of political obligation is to show that the treatment of ordinary coordination problems can be extended to other game theoretic situations, such as the prisonerâs dilemma. I find that the conventionalist account is able to answer the objection that any conventionalist account of authority and political obligation is misguided because the conventionalist analysis cannot properly be applied to situations of significant conflict of interests. I also argue that, in order to defend the conventionalist view according to which political obligation is to be justified by reference to a pattern of mutual expectations, one should make crucial use of the idea of cooperative dispositions. To this end, I show that conventionalists are right in claiming that assumptions about cooperative dispositions are not ad hoc, and, hence, that conventionalism can make sense of the idea that patterns of mutual expectations are not immune to moral criticism.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (1326k),ETD,Unrestricted,,Political obligation,,PhD,2,fphtug01.pdf

Frankfurt developed his hierarchical theory of desires. This controversial theory led to fruitful debates not only in connection with the problem of free will but in other areas as well including personal and practical identity, rationality in action and the problem of agency in general. Thus, this dissertation is not focused on the problem of free will but on the role of second-order desires in agency. More particularly, it discusses the importance of two features of human agency that Frankfurt emphasized most. First, humans are reflective, that is, they can evaluate their own desires. Second, humans are capable of caring about things, that is, some things are important for them in a special way. Frankfurt understands both of these crucial abilities as based on our ability to have second-order desires. In agreement with Frankfurt, I will argue that both reflectivity and caring are very important and basic abilities, and that they are connected to each other. However, I will disagree about their relation and about the definition of caring as dependent on second-order desires. I will argue that caring in the most basic sense is not a reflective ability but a first-order evaluation which is centrally important to action. I will also try to show that the reason humans have second-order desires is that they care about things. Thus, our second-order desires should be based on our personal values; in other words, what we care about. As a consequence, the most important claim of this dissertation is the following: though humans are reflective creatures, it is not reflectivity that is the most important feature of human life. Rather, caring, as a first-order evaluation is more important and our ability to reflect about our motivation depends on being able to care about things in this sense. At the end of the dissertation I will briefly discuss a serious problem for any caring based theory of action: the problem of self-control and self-management. Since we do not directly control by decisions what we care about, it seems that we cannot have these abilities. However, I will try to sketch a method of self-control and self-management which is consistent with the importance of the redefined concept of caring and which is based on self-trust and openness. This method will add one more argument against the importance of reflectivity: second-order desires do not help us in managing our desires; rather, they can interfere with self-control and become self-defeating strategies.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (694k),ETD,,Free will and determinism,,PhD,2,fphwaz01.pdf

The interviews with the magazine employees uncover troubling situation with the state institutions and the collapse of the safety net, and the attempts that the magazine is doing to offer support to its vendors. Such support often goes beyond a basic selling training, taking the role of the missing state institutions particularly regarding various trainings for job search and mental health support. Finally, the interviews with the vendors question the market model imposed on them, and ideas of sale efficiency as a mean to improve their social condition during the post-socialist transformation.

For Aristotle phantasia is a motion of the perceptive soul that makes possible a great amount of activities and higher cognitions beyond sense-perception. Phantasia became a fundamental psychological concept in the Hellenistic Era: in empiricist epistemology, in action theory as perceptual representation of the external world; in aesthetics as creative imagination. I argue that Alexander proceeds from an Aristotelian framework of parts and capacities of the soul, but unlike Aristotle, he distinguishes a distinct capacity for phantasia. The main reason for this comes from his polemic against the Stoics: they do not acknowledge an activity of phantasia. A distinct activity requires a distinct object, which in turn a distinct capacity. The distinct status of a phantasia-capacity in itself modifies the architecture of the soul in comparison with Aristotle. But in addition Alexander makes important changes in the framework: he makes capacities as basic (and rather modular), and parts and the soul as sets of capacities. The object of phantasia is the residue from perception in activity. The status of this as internal object needs clarification. I show that it is internal on account of being a physical process in the body. Again, I argue that it is the causal object of phantasia: it is the item that provides content to the phantasia-activity by triggering it. But the residue is not an intentional object: it is a representation of something else. I give a reconstruction of Alexander`s account how the residue may be representation. Accordingly, it is a representation in virtue of preserving fully a perceptual content (something that had been perceived); or in virtue of functioning as an equivalent of a fully preserved residue insofar as phantasia completed an incompletely preserved residue. The latter case explains a wide range of cases, in general the fact that phantasia is more prone to error than perception. Finally I analyse the activity of phantasia. I argue that its content is propositional, in particular it is âS is Pâ: a predication of a perceptible feature P of a thing that caused a perception S. First, I show that it is implausible to construe simple cases of phantasia (or perception: for perception has the same type of content as phantasia) as non-propositional, demonstrating that the object reading of the content (x sees âwhiteâ) is inadequate in that at the best it reduces to existential propositions (âthere is whiteâ). Again, I analyse two positive evidences. (1) Alexander`s account of the truth-conditions of phantasia implies propositional content: phantasia is about an existent thing, S; and it is such as the thing, P. (2) The account of simultaneous perception (of several perceptibles) entails propositional content, and even uses examples as âthis is whiteâ. The phantasia-activity is said to be krisis, which I take to be judgement: primarily because its content is propositional. I argue that it is a certain type of judgement, perceptual, in contrast to conceptual judgements of the rational soul-part: esp. opinion. However, phantasia-judgement may be distinguished from perceptual judgement only because they are concerned with different objects: internal vs. external.",Degree: PhD,,Aristotle,,PhD,2,hangai_attila.pdf

The scope of this thesis is to investigate nature and scale of MNCsâ political authority in the international system through the analysis of the CSR regime to provide for a better understanding of these new forms of governance. Yet, for this to be possible, a context-specific study of power is needed. Following a power analysis in which different power considerations are connected to different possible reasons for MNCsâ compliance with socially-responsible policies, CSR is here interpreted as a system of self-discipline and conformity from which MNCs result being both empowered and constrained. CSR â a by-product of the broader neoliberal regime of governmentality â by redefining the boundaries between public and private, invests firms with political authority while at the same time reinventing their social role in a way that the resulting system of governance ultimately both governs through and consists of the very success of its discourse in the global economy.",Degree: MA,PDF file (682k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,ilardo_matteo.pdf

It examines the dynamics of EU interventions in conflicts, asking: Why and under what conditions does the EU decide to get involved in conflict resolution? In a conflict-prone world and competing security priorities, what determines EU involvement in particular conflicts? Do supranational institutions, such as the European Commission and the EU Council Secretariat, matter in initiating, shaping and implementing EU policies on conflict resolution? To answer these questions, I use institutionalist and intergovernmentalist theories to assess their relative explanatory power in accounting for the patterns of EU interventions in conflict. I find that these approaches are broadly complementary: institutionalism explains EU interventions in the low-politics areas of conflict resolution, while intergovernmentalism explains EU behaviour in the high-politics areas of intervention. When it comes to intervention in conflicts, EU foreign policy is like a light airplane: it can fly without being caught on radar as long as it flies âlowâ. By flying low (and slow), such an airplane can advance quite far into âenemyâ territory. However, if it increases its altitude above a certain threshold, it risks being detected by radars, and actions may be taken to halt the aircraft. The same holds true for EU interventions in conflicts. To avoid challenging EU member states, EU institutions often employ stealth intervention, operating predominantly in uncontroversial and depoliticised aspects of conflict resolution. By âflying low,â they are thus able to gradually extend their mandate from low-politics areas of conflict resolution to the high politics realm of overt intervention. Using a strategy I call âdosageâ, EU institutions engage in a series of low-cost actions, which, over a longer period of time, can yield significant cumulated policy impact. However, if their involvement becomes suddenly controversial, as when EU institutions enter suddenly into the realm of high-politics, EU member states may move to limit their autonomy.  The dissertation traces the politics of stealth intervention by EU institutions using unpublished empirical data related to the EU decision-making process as well as interactions between the EU institutions, EU member states, and Russia in the conflict zones in question.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (306k),ETD,European Union -- Former Soviet republics,,PhD,2,iphpon01.pdf

Considering the ways through which the humanoid becomes sexualized and racialized, I will argue that Sophia enfolds the potentiality of subversion, that is of interest for feminist epistemology. In the theoretical framework of the first chapter, I will provide the reader with a genealogy of the category of human by focusing on the canonical patriarchal understanding of the rational man in Western philosophy, while also addressing the category of human species, so as to illustrate how these approaches formulated research in Artificial Intelligence. In the second chapter, I will provide a close reading analysis of Michel Foucault and Brian Massumiâs scholarship that bridges biopower and capitalism to the affect and the bodyâs materiality. Based on this, I will read the trope of emotionality used in Sophiaâs case in relation to the modulation of affect in late capitalism. This way, I intend to illustrate how Sophia is imbedded in a much more nuanced web of relations of power, one that redefines the boundaries between who is included in the category of the human species and who is not. In the third chapter, by employing Michel Foucaultâs analysis on biopower while also engaging with Norman Faircloughâs critical discourse analysis I will draw attention to the discursive traces that construct Sophiaâs identity in accordance to the biopolitical technologies of race and sexuality. Finally, in last chapter, drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattariâs analysis on the abstract machine of faciality and Judith Butlerâs approach on drag I will reflect on the constructiveness of the boundaries between the human and the non-human, to argue that Sophia is not just a product of her time but also a point of disruption that might unravel what Deleuze and Guattari call, the inhuman in the human.",Degree: MA,PDF,ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,kasdovasili_stella.pdf

Paradigm changes are implemented in societies first and foremost through a redefinition of indicators. Our current indicator systems do not take into account the complexity of human social, economic and material systems and prioritize âefficiencyâ and âgrowthâ. The objective of this research was to develop an indicator for one type of anthropogenic complex systems, i.e. cities that took into account the complex nature of the system and provided a quantitative way to prioritize alternative values such as âresilienceâ and âsustainabilityâ. Scaling has been identified as one measure of complexity in a system, which is relatively easy to compute and comprehend. Here, I have developed a scaling indicator for cities based on fractal dimension. US block wise census data was used to calculate the exponent of the power-law distribution of population density across different census blocks in a city. The power-law, or scaling indicator, herein referred to as the fractal dimension was then compared to parameters such as population, area, population density, gasoline sales, gasoline sales per capita and area, and carbon emissions and carbon emissions per capita. It was noted that the fractal dimension had a power-law correlation with gasoline sales per unit area in the cities. The analysis was then extended a second complex system, i.e. national economies. Fractal dimension or scaling of percentages of incomes across the highest earning to lowest earning twenty percent segments of the population was calculated using World Bank economic data for 2004 (the year for which most extensive dataset was available). The relationship between this scaling indicator and energy usage per capita in countries was again found to be a power-law with an r-square value of more than 0.35 (similar to the correlation between urban fractal dimension and gasoline sales per area in cities). A new planning tool is developed to allow incorporation of consideration of these complexity indicators in development planning for cities and national economies. The planning-plane allows for visualization of the impacts of particular interventions in cities (e.g. housing scheme) and economies (e.g. changes in tax-code) on energy consumption parameters across two independent variables (e.g. population and fractal dimension) instead of the usual practice of using one indicator (e.g. population density). The similar nature of the correlation between scaling indicators and energy consumption indicators in two completely different anthropogenic complex systems hints at some underlying similarity in the mechanism through which these complex systems develop. It is hypothesized here that steeper scaling (e.g. higher income differences in economies) in complex systems makes good system regulation more energy intensive, thereby affecting the energy consumption parameters as observed in this study. Steeper scaling also thus negatively affects the effectiveness of regulation in complex systems and makes the system more prone to internal shocks. Planning system evolution for resilience would thus benefit from consideration of scaling indicators in the planning process.",ETD,Unrestricted,City planning -- Environmental aspects,,PhD,2,khan_fouad.pdf

Notwithstanding the persistent interest in the study of state censorship, the aspect that certain levels of coordination have to occur under invariably vague regulations is surprisingly neglected. Yet, given the role played by censorship in sustaining non-democratic regimes, the Soviet-type for instance on which the present analysis is centered, how the system internally managed to deal with uncertainties concerning censorship norms, and how the main actors coped with it, is surely a pertinent question. The research was designed to address both formal and informal aspects of the censorship process. For assessing formal organizational solutions, I use mid-level theories developed in the vein of the structural contingency approach to organizational design, whereas for the study of informal practices, I draw on theoretical insights offered by the comparative political science literature and a conceptual typology of informal practices/institutions that I developed based on three typologies (Nee and Ingram 1998, Lauth 2000, Helmke and Levitsky 2006a). In terms of methods, I combine institutional analysis and historical ethnography, which involves processing data derived from official documents and subjective sources (interviews, memoirs, diaries and contemporary correspondence). The empirical analysis is based on a single case, that is, the Romanian censorship system in the state socialist period (1949â1989). Within the case, the focus on formal mechanisms is narrowed to the extreme end of the pre-publication procedure, the activity of local censorsâ offices namely. With regards to informal mechanisms, the analysis is focalized on positive interpersonal relationships between the actors of the censorship system, particularly those nurtured among the controllers and controlled, and the allied informal practices. The intensive analysis of the Romanian case resulted that the effective implementation of the censorship policy was maintained by a complex set of formal organizational coordination and control mechanisms that were appropriately designed to meet critical contingencies (i.e. task uncertainty), as well as by various types of informal practices based on trust-centered interpersonal ties. The types of informal practices that furthered the formal scopes of censorship include the spread and clarification of information regarding censorship norms via peers and censors (complementary informal practices), censors sharing confidential directives (accommodating practices), as well as counseling and ensuring with controllers prior to official checking (substitutive practices). The fourth type comprises interactions that eventually undermined the effectiveness of the censorship policy, practices such as negotiations between the censors and editors-in-chief/authors, intervening through personalized networks on behalf of a publication, or taking a risk by turning a blind eye to problematic issues (competing of practices). These findings complement accounts of the functioning and effectiveness of the Soviet-type censorship system primarily focused on macro institutional and organizational configurations. Furthermore, the results shed light on practices constituting the domain of âself-censorshipâ, which is also claimed by the literature to represent an important factor contributing to the effectiveness of censorship. Finally, by focusing on positive interpersonal ties and related practices, the findings considerably alter the dominant narrative centered on negative relationships between the controllers and the controlled, yet they also show that many interactions based on positive ties had the same effects as their negative counterparts: raising the performance of the censorship system.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2650k),ETD,Unrestricted,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD,2,kiss_agnes.pdf

This act eliminated discrimination against certain ethnic groups that had persisted since the Immigration Act of 1924 which established the National Origins Formula. Under the National Origins Formula, immigration quotas were put into place in order to limit the number of immigrants from regions of the world that would negatively alter the ethnic distribution of the United States. The era within which the Hart-Celler Act was passed was one of a great change in the psyche of the U.S. demos towards a more liberal, global way of thinking by removing these quotas and creating a better system through which residency could be acquired. The changing of times and inability to address it since, however, has led to immigration becoming a forefront of political debate in the United States today. This has culminated in the presidential campaign and subsequent election of Donald J. Trump, whose primary campaign issue revolved around racially charged sentiments and the problems of immigration. My aim here is to assess, from relevant data and evidence, the impact of the Hart-Celler Act by examining a) how it improved or faulted as legislation upon its predecessor â via reallocation of immigration slots from Northern Europe to 3rd world inhabitants or the creation of chain migration â and b) the economic and social consequences that have occurred in the fifty years following. I shall follow this up by developing a normative scale upon which to judge the competing immigration theories, which is succeeded by taking a look at philosophical literature in search of providing a clearer picture regarding the moral debate surrounding immigration today. I conclude a) that Congress passed a law improving on many of the shortcomings of its predecessor, though it has not been spared criticism on pragmatic grounds; and b) that the legislative changes cultivated fairly positive economic consequences. Additionally, I assert that sole adherence to either theory of immigration is too narrow in approaching the problem of reform and that collaborative measures that are understanding of both sidesâ interpretations of justice is the most suitable path forward.",,PDF file (924k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,lazarescu_paul.pdf

In light of this analysis, I argue that the Hungarian Fidesz party, with OrbÃ¡n at its helm, has engaged in the social creativity strategy of identity management and created a new claim on Christian Democracy. This claim combines nationalism, populism, and civilizationism, wherein the âChristianâ component of Christian Democracy is central. The German Christian Democratic Union, headed by Angela Merkel has made no such grand ideological claims but rather has been characterized by caution, pragmatism and centrism. Even while refusing to backdown rhetorically from a defense of the rights of asylum seekers and the responsibility of Germany, and the EU more broadly, to help, their policy making reflected collaboration, cooperation, and concession on these principles. The Austrian Peopleâs Party engages in both approaches, fluctuating between the two without overindulging in either. The approach this paper takes, and the examples put forth by these parties can be utilized to investigate trends in other Christian Democratic parties, or even other party families, in the wake of major events.

The proposal is viewed as part of an expanding array of mechanisms aimed at guaranteeing victims rights. I ground the proposal in an understanding of the goals of transitional justice, and the alternative measures available to meet these goals. Coming to a final verdict in an international criminal trial is an important step toward meeting transitional justice goals including the utilitarian and retributive goals achieved through ruling on liability, and symbolic justice for victims. In general, trial in absentia is viewed as acceptable by international and regional human rights courts if safeguards are met. Different international tribunals have approached trial in absentia with varying degrees of tolerance. This thesis examines international and regional standards surrounding trial in absentia, including case-law from the Human Rights Committee (HRC), International Criminal Court (ICC), International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and concludes that partial in absentia trials will likely continue to be permitted in international law. This thesis devotes a separate chapter to analysis of trial in absentia at the International Military Tribunal (IMT) and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the Statutes of which explicitly allow for proceedings in the absence of the defendant. Despite the strong tradition dictating that a trial should end upon the death of defendant, legal theory and precedent shows that international criminal law allows for some procedural flexibility in favor victimâs rights, due to the gravity of international core crimes and the sui generis nature of international tribunals. In order to establish guidelines surrounding when flexibility can occur, this thesis examines international law in the frame of Packerâs two models, as well as the work of Damaska and MegrÃ©t, and case-law from the European Court of Human Rights. The thesis concludes by examining how trial in absentiaâusually resulting from the flight of the defendant, the defendantâs refusal to appear at his or her trial, the defendantâs disruption of the courtroom, or serious medical needs of the defendantâcan apply to cases where the defendant has died, without violating human rights norms.

In the last four decades many linguist, philosopher and cognitive scientist, working on an account of how we communicate by means of metaphors, started with pointing out what Davidson got wrong or right. His view that metaphor carries no special meaning or content different form the literal meaning of the expressions it is comprised of, that it is simply a tool to draw our attention to similarities, served as the starting point for many to articulate their own theory (cf. Bergmann, 1982; Rorty and Hesse, 1987; Moran, 1989; Hills, 1997; Stern, 2000; Camp, 2003; Guttenplan, 2005; Reimer and Camp, 2006; Camp, 2008; Stern, 2008; Reimer, 2008; Lepore and Stone, 2010). îis thesis is no different. I think what Davidson essentially got right is emphasizing the causal effects of metaphors, i.e., that metaphors nudge us into noting similarities, to take on a new perspective on the mentioned things. He also thoughtâto anticipate, this will be where I disagreeâthat this is the ulterior aim of metaphor and the metaphorical speaker. Consequently, according to Davidson, there is no special meaning the speaker aims to convey, given that this effect can be achieved by the literal meaning of the uttered sentence, or its comprehension thereof. îis is not to deny that the metaphor has a point iv or that it inspires a lot of thoughts. In his Communication and Convention, Davidson (1984, 273) links what he calls ulterior purposes of utterances to John L. Austinâs notion of perlocution (Austin, 1962); acts people perform by uttering sentences. Such an act for instance is, making the audience to undertake certain actions by asking them to do so, or to surprise them by what one is saying. Given this much, Davidson (1978) can be described as developing a perlocutionary theory of metaphor (cf. Lepore and Stone, 2010). My aim is to show that a perlocutionary theory does not have to follow Davidsonâs arguments and conclusions, just roughly outlined above. After a careful examiniation of the notion of metaphorical meaning, the perspectival effect of metaphors, and the notion of perlocution and perlocutionary effects, I will argue, first, that metaphorsâs effect of making us see something in a new light is indeed a perlocutionary effect. I call this the Perlocution Claim. Second, I will also point out that achieving perlocutionary effects are not necessarily the ulterior purposes of the speakers. In most cases, they are just one among the many intended effects a speaker can have in uttering something. Consequently, Davidsonâs claims about the casual effects of metaphors will not support his conclusion that there is no metaphorical meaning beyond the perspectival effect of metaphors, in as much as there are examples where eliciting the metaphorical effect is not the final aim of the speaker. Examples are not hard to find, and they support the existence of metaphorical meaning contrary to Davidson. Nevertheless, recent theories of metaphorical meaning do not fit well with the Perlocution Claim. Partly, because they reject the claim as belonging to Davidsonian non-cognitivsm (cf. Stern, 2000), a label introduced to designate theories denying the existence of metaphorical meaning. Additionally, because they also consider perlocutionary effects to be final, non-linguistic, aims of utterances. îe proposed theory of metaphor endorsing the Perlocution Claim relies on the v distinction between different possible realizations of perlocutionary effects. It incorporates a non-cognitivist theory for some examples of metaphors while at the same time, using the same theoretical framework, it provides an account of how metaphorical utterances have a special meaning on certain occasions. As a theory of metaphorical meaning, it is close to that developed by Elisabeth Camp (2003; 2008; 2014) on which if there is a metaphorical meaning, it is an inexplicit meaning which the hearer has to recover by way of cultivating the perspective offered in the metaphor.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (641k),ETD,,Language and languages -- Philosophy,,PhD,2,somodi_gergo.pdf

The concept of gender rather treated as an isolated category than as a social factor which intersects with other categories of identity for purposes of understanding and combating inequality. The aim of this dissertation has been to explain and analyze through empirical material the manifestations of gender, ethnicity and class in contemporary Romani womenâs life. To narrow my study, I have focused on transnational and local (particularly Hungarian) Romani womenâs political activism and social status, from the structural through the discursive and biographical level. I aimed to go beyond the superficial representation of womenâs activism, by describing the complicated relationship and intercations among donors, NGOs, other Roma and non-Roma activists, and also within their groups. With the above outlined concerns in my mind, I undertook an empirical research project at the transnational level (mapping the various Roma networks and international resource centers) and at the local level (SzikszÃ³, Hungary). As part of my research, I closely observed âwomenâs issuesâ at the transnational and the local level, as well as discourses and activities through which they promote âRomani womenâs rightsâ and âhuman rights and democracyâ under the banners of âempowering Romani womenâ. This area is under-researched and lacks theoretical conceptualization. The approach I have opted to take bridges empirical and theoretical gaps in the study of sociology and anthropology, particularly in respect of the representation of Roma in the academic text as well as to raise the profile of the research field by diminishing the marginalized position of them within the social sciences as a whole.",Degree: PhD,PDF file (2324k),ETD,Unrestricted,"Women, Romani -- Hungary",,PhD,2,sphkoc01.pdf

Empirical evidence is mixed. Where success is absent, it remains unclear whether this is due to an insufficient implementation of ACAs and the legal framework they operate in or, as other scholars suggest, a misconceptualisation of systemic corruption. The present work addresses this controversy by bringing the deterrence effect and the political selection effect that the predominant principalagent- theory based literature suggests to an empirical test in the critical case of Romania. This is done by assessing the impact of National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) prosecution in two forms â the announcement of investigations and the announcement of the final sentence â on favouritism in local public procurement. Based on 1.4 million public procurement contracts, Propensity Score Matching is employed to estimate the Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATTs) and the Conditional Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (CATTs) for Romanian localities affected by DNA prosecution concerning a composite risk score based on three red flags in the tendering process and a market domination indicator. The data reveals that the theoretical predictions cannot be confirmed.

Established 20 years ago as a voluntary cooperation initiative on higher education cooperation in Europe, the BP has set important policy objectives for national higher education systems and Europe at large. While government representatives, through the ministerial meetings constantly agree on what they should implement in their national higher education systems, implementation reports show considerable differences between countries and higher education institutions (HEIs) with regard to implementation. Starting with the early stages of the BP scholarly work has demonstrated that there is an increasing interest in studying the different dimensions of BP implementation. A considerable amount of these studies has focused on assessing and explaining the different levels of BP implementation yet there is a gap in addressing the implementation of the BP from an integrated perspective. This dissertation aimed to fill this gap and asked What are the factors explaining the different levels of implementation of higher education policies within the Bologna Process? First of all, this dissertation seeks address the research gap by focusing on specific policy areas within the BP (quality assurance and the social dimension), diverse county contexts and higher education institutions within such contexts (Moldova, Portugal, and Romania). Secondly, it aims to contribute to the broader policy implementation literature by providing a conceptual understanding of policy implementation, by breaking it into adoption, transposition and practical implementation, and by putting forward an integrated set of factors for each of the three implementation stages, and empirically test them through semi-structured interviews. The dissertation hypothesizes three causal mechanisms for each of the implementation levels. Firstly, is hypothesized that adoption is the result of policy fit between commonly agreed policies at the BP level and national preferences and interests, as resulted through national representativesâ participation in BP. The causal model predicts that if BP policies have the support of top domestic actors and structures, this may push the national policies closer to the ones promoted by the BP. As a result, BP structures prefer to collaborate with those domestic actors who are in favor of its policies. Secondly, specific to the transposition stage it can be hypothesized that mutual learning and other socialization processes equip governmental agencies and bodies, societal actors, and the academic community with information about the main developments at the EHEA level and contribute to national level policy-making by feeding back national policy makers, affecting the choice for specific policy instruments and implementation mechanisms. Last but not least, at the HEIs level rectors and top-managers, academic and administrative staff, and students develop institutional plans and policies in line with the national level policies or the BP depending on their participation as stakeholders in the policy-making processes, autonomy and the added value of the policies in question. First of all, this dissertation highlighted the complex relationship between the BP, national, and institutional policy-making and the importance of national and institutional (interest) structures, actors (coalitions) and processes in connecting these levels. While it is assumed that that there is a âfilterâ when it comes to the implementation the BP commitments, with each level and layer of policy-making preconditioning the following (adopting the necessary legislation, transposition and institutional practices) this dissertation has shown that this is very much dependent on the policy in question. Quality assurance (QA) is a rather structural and technical area, with clear conceptualizations and operationalizations, with structures and bodies at the European, national and institutional level, whereas the social dimension (SD) is underdeveloped in this respect. HEIs implement QA policies because of the competitive environment they have to operate in but also because of the existent monitoring mechanisms (at the institutional, national and BP level). The SD is a rather sensitive area, with most of the universities putting forward their preferred approaches on how to deal with such issues. If in the case of QA in most of the country cases there is a national level agency which pushes for implementation at the HEIs level, in the case of SD the situation is loose.",ETD,"CEU Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations",,PhD,2,torotcoi_simona.pdf

The full-fledged model corroborates the developmentalistsâ claim regarding the inferential support for imitative learning. It strengthens the argument that infantsâ learning of practical skills and artifact functions from observation of adult human agents is an instance of teleological instrumental rationality. However the roles of perceptual, motor, or memory capacities of the human mind are also considered.

Limited evidence in the existing literature suggests that the Overview Effect â the cognitive shift in awareness experienced by astronauts as a result of seeing Earth from outer space â may contain much greater ecological dimensions than has been previously implied. Based on 14 first-hand interviews with astronauts, this study utilizes interpretive phenomenological analysis to qualitatively demonstrate that the Overview Effect has a distinct ecological significance that results in positive changes to astronautsâ environmental attitudes and behaviours. Besides this change, the results qualitatively map the breadth and depth of astronautsâ present environmental attitudes and behaviours, which has also not been done prior to this study. The outer space perspective of Earth, which includes negative perceptual views of anthropogenic ecological destruction on the surface of the planet, is shown to add a new and additional element to environmentalism, and as such discourse analysis is used to demonstrate how the ecological impulse concept is useful for advancing theoretical formulations of how spaceflight affects environmental attitudes. Furthermore, an expanded definition of the astroenvironmentalism concept is proposed to encapsulate this distinct form of environmentalism, to facilitate more straightforward discussions on the topic, and to make this phenomenon and form of environmentalism more relevant and accessible to a wider audience.",Degree: MSc,PDF file (1581k),ETD,Unrestricted,System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader; PostScript compatible printer,,,MA,2,voski_anais.pdf

Topic is important since gender-based myths and stereotypes hinder womenâs access to justice and in long term contribute to their re-victimization, especially in cases that are so delicate as rape. Research focuses on the practice and jurisprudence of the regional human rights bodies (namely, the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) in addressing and combating harmful gender-based stereotypes. The aim of this comparative analysis is to answer which regional actor went the furthest in addressing and contesting gender-based stereotypes in general, particularly those that are prevalent in rape cases. Also, establishing their âbest practicesâ is important because such practice can be useful to states which are not successful in fulfilling their international and regional obligations in this specific field.
