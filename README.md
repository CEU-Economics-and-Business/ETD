# ETD: Ethical Theses and Dissertations
The goal of this project is to estimate the number of student theses and dissertations that fall under the purview of the Ethical Research Committee of CEU. We analyze a representative sample of theses from the last 3 years to estimate the fraction of theses using human subjects research or data subject to privacy concerns.
